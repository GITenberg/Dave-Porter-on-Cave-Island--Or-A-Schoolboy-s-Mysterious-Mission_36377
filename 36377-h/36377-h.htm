<p><span style='font-size:larger;'>PREFACE</span></p>
</div>
<p>
<span class='sc'>“Dave Porter on Cave Island”</span> is a complete
story in itself but forms the eighth volume
in a line issued under the general title of “Dave
Porter Series.”
</p>
<p>
The opening tale of this series, called “Dave
Porter at Oak Hall,” related the adventures of
a wide-awake lad at a typical boarding school
of to-day. This was followed by “Dave Porter
in the South Seas,” whither our hero had gone to
find his father, and then by “Dave Porter’s Return
to School.”
</p>
<p>
From Oak Hall, Dave journeyed to Norway,
as related in “Dave Porter in the Far North.”
On his return to this country he once more attended
school, as told of in “Dave Porter and
His Classmates.” Dave made a host of friends
and likewise a few enemies, and some of the latter
plotted to do him much harm.
</p>
<p>
When vacation came once more, Dave received
an invitation to visit a home in the far west, and
what he did on that trip has been set forth in
“Dave Porter at Star Ranch.” Then, when vacation
days were at an end, he came back to Oak
Hall, as related in the seventh volume of this
series, entitled, “Dave Porter and His Rivals.”
</p>
<p>
In the present book we find Dave again at
school. But the Christmas holidays are at hand
and the lad returns home. Here a most mysterious
and unlooked-for happening occurs, and
Dave’s great benefactor, Mr. Wadsworth, is on
the verge of ruin because of it. Dave gets a clew
to the mystery, and, with his chums, resolves to
investigate. He takes a long journey and has a
number of stirring adventures, the particulars of
which are given in the pages that follow.
</p>
<p>
When I started this line of books I trusted that
Dave might please the boys, but I did not imagine
that so many thousands of boys and girls all over
the land would clamor as they have for more
concerning the doings of my hero. I thank all
for their appreciation of my efforts to please them,
and I sincerely trust that the reading of this new
volume will be a benefit to them.

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_1'></a>1</span>DAVE PORTER ON CAVE ISLAND</h2>
<h2><a name='chI' id='chI'></a>CHAPTER I—THE SCHOOLBOY CHUMS</h2>
<p>
“Come on, fellows, if you are going! It’s a
good six-mile skate to Squirrel Island, and we’ve
got to hustle if we want to get there in time
for lunch.”
</p>
<p>
“Wait till I fix my right skate, Dave,” returned
Phil Lawrence. “I don’t want to lose it on the
way.”
</p>
<p>
“Say, that puts me in mind of a story,” came
from another of the group of schoolboys who
were adjusting their skates. “Once a man asked
for a pair of skates for——”
</p>
<p>
“Stow it, Shadow!” interrupted Dave Porter.
“We haven’t any time now to listen to stories.
You can tell them while we are resting up at the
island.”
</p>
<p>
“Shadow can tell stories while we put away
the lunch,” observed Roger Morr, with a grin.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2'></a>2</span>
</p>
<p>
“Not much!” cried the lad mentioned. “I
guess that skate will make me as hungry as anybody—and
the stories will keep.”
</p>
<p>
“I thought Ben Basswood was going, too?”
came from another of the schoolboys.
</p>
<p>
“Here he comes, Lazy,” answered Dave, and
as he spoke he pointed to a path across the snow-covered
campus, along which another boy was hurrying,
skates in hand.
</p>
<p>
“Co-couldn’t get here an-any so-sooner!”
panted Ben, as he dropped on a bench to adjust
his skates. “Old Haskers made me do some
extra work in Latin! Wow, but don’t I love that
man!”
</p>
<p>
“We all do,” answered Phil. “We are going
to get up a testimonial to him. A silver-mounted——”
</p>
<p>
“Slice of punk, with an ancient lemon on top,”
finished Dave. “It’s just what he’s been waiting
for.” And at this sally there was a general laugh.
</p>
<p>
“Well, I’m ready,” went on Phil, as he arose
from the bench. “Say, but isn’t it just a glorious
day for the outing?” he added, casting his eyes
around and drawing in a deep breath of the pure,
cold air.
</p>
<p>
“It couldn’t be better, Phil,” answered Dave.
“And we ought to have a fine time at the island,
bringing down rabbits and squirrels. Old Jerry
Lusk told me that hunting was never better.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3'></a>3</span>
</p>
<p>
“What’s the matter with having some of the
rabbits and squirrels for lunch?” asked Sam Day.
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps we can cook them, Sam,” returned
Dave. “But we had better depend on the lunch
hamper for something to eat. By the way, we’ll
have to take turns carrying the hamper. It is
rather heavy.”
</p>
<p>
“Chip Macklin and I are going to carry it
first,” said a tall, strong youth named Gus Plum.
“It’s not so very heavy, although it is filled with
good things.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t lose it, on your life!” cried Phil.
</p>
<p>
“Lose it!” echoed Roger Morr. “Banish the
thought! We’ll form a guard around Gus and
Chip, so they can’t get away with it on the sly.”
</p>
<p>
“Not so much as a doughnut must be eaten
until we reach the island and start a campfire,”
said Dave. “Those are orders from headquarters,”
he added, with a grand flourish.
</p>
<p>
“Orders accepted, admiral!” cried Gus, and
made a bow so profound that his skates went
from under him, sending him to his knees. This
caused a wild laugh, and the powerfully-built
youth got up in a hurry, looking rather sheepish.
</p>
<p>
“I’m ready now,” said Ben, as he left the
bench and settled his skating cap on his head.
“Come on, let’s get away before old Haskers
calls us back for something or other. He just
loves to spoil a fellow’s outing.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4'></a>4</span>
</p>
<p>
“There he is at one of the windows!” cried
Roger, pointing back to the school building. “I
really believe he is beckoning to us!”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t look,” cautioned Dave. “He’ll want
us to go back, to put away some books, or clean
our desks, or something. Doctor Clay said we
could take this outing, and I’m not going to let
any teacher spoil it. Forward!” and away from
the shore he skated, with his chums around him.
They had scarcely covered a distance of a dozen
yards when a window was thrown up hastily, and
Job Haskers thrust his head through the opening.
</p>
<p>
“Boys! boys!” called out the Oak Hall teacher.
“Wait a minute! I want to know where you are
going, and if all of you have finished studying.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t look back, and don’t answer!” said
Roger, in a hoarse whisper.
</p>
<p>
“Give the school yell!” suggested Phil.
</p>
<p>
“Just the thing!” returned Sam Day. “Now
then, all together!” And an instant later through
the clear, wintry air, rang the well-known Oak
Hall slogan:
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Baseball!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Football!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oak&nbsp;&nbsp;Hall<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;call!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Biff!&nbsp;&nbsp;Boom!&nbsp;&nbsp;Bang!&nbsp;&nbsp;Whoop!”<br />
</p>
<p>
Three times the boys gave the cry, and by that
time they had skated far up the river and out of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5'></a>5</span>
sight of the window at which the teacher was
standing. Job Haskers looked after them glumly,
and then closed the window with a bang.
</p>
<p>
“They must have heard me—I don’t see how
they could help it,” he muttered to himself.
“Such disrespect! I’ll make them toe the mark
for it when they get back! Bah! Doctor Clay
is altogether too easy with the boys. If I were
running this school I’d make them mind!” And
the teacher shut his teeth grimly. He was a
man who thought that the boys ought to spend
all their time in studying. The hours devoted to
outdoor exercise he considered practically wasted.
He was too short-sighted to realize that, in order
to have a perfectly sound mind, one must likewise
have a sound body.
</p>
<p>
“He’ll have it in for us when we get back,”
murmured Chip Macklin. “My! how he does
love to stop a fellow’s fun!”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t worry,” chimed in Roger. “Sufficient
unto the hour is the lecture thereof. Let us enjoy
this outing while it lasts, and let come what will
when we get back.”
</p>
<p>
“Which puts me in mind of another story,”
broke in Shadow Hamilton. “A fellow used to
eat too much, and he had to take his medicine
regularly, to keep from getting indigestion. So
once—wow!” And Shadow broke off short, for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6'></a>6</span>
Phil had suddenly put out his foot, sending the
story-teller of Oak Hall sprawling.
</p>
<p>
“So he had to take his medicine,” repeated
Dave, gravely.
</p>
<p>
“Did the medicine agree with him?” asked
Roger, innocently.
</p>
<p>
“He took it lying down, didn’t he?” questioned
Gus.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll ‘medicine’ you!” roared Shadow, as he
scrambled to his feet. Then he made a wild dash
after the youth who had tripped him up, but Phil
had skated on ahead and he took good care that
Shadow did not catch him. “I won’t tell you another
story for a year!” the story-teller growled,
after the chase was at an end.
</p>
<p>
“Phew! Shadow says he is going to reform!”
murmured Ben.
</p>
<p>
“Let it pass, Shadow!” cried Dave, not wishing
the story-teller to take the matter too seriously.
“You can tell all the stories you please around
the campfire. But just now let us push on as fast
as we can. I want a chance to do some rabbit
and squirrel hunting, and you know we’ve got to
be back on time, or we’ll have trouble with Doctor
Clay as well as with old Haskers.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, and I want to take some pictures before
it gets too dark,” said Sam, who had his camera
along.
</p>
<p>
“Do you know what Horsehair told me?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7'></a>7</span>
came from Roger. “He said we were fixing for
another snowstorm.”
</p>
<p>
“It doesn’t look so now,” returned Dave.
“But Horsehair generally hits it on the weather,
so maybe we’ll catch it before we get back.”
</p>
<p>
“Wonder if we’ll meet any of the Rockville
cadets?” remarked Phil, as he and Dave forged
to the front, they knowing the way up the river
better than did some of the others.
</p>
<p>
“It is possible, Phil. All of them have guns,
and I should think they would like to go hunting.”
</p>
<p>
“I guess most of their firearms are rifles, not
fowling-pieces.”
</p>
<p>
“Not more than half—I learned that from
Mallory, when we played hockey. He said they
had some shotguns just for hunting and camping out
purposes.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, those chaps have a holiday to-day, the
same as we have, so some of them may be up
around Squirrel Island. But I’d rather not meet
them,” and Dave’s face became serious.
</p>
<p>
“Humph! If those military academy fellows
try to play any tricks on us I reckon we can give
’em as good as they send,” growled Phil.
</p>
<p>
“To be sure we can, Phil. But I’d rather keep
out of trouble to-day and have some good, clean
sport. I haven’t been hunting this season and I’m
just itching to draw a bead on a fat bunny, or
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8'></a>8</span>
squirrel, or some partridges. You know, I used
to go hunting in the woods around Crumville,
when I was home.”
</p>
<p>
“Why, of course! Didn’t Roger and I go
along once? But we didn’t get much that trip,
although we did get into a lively row with Nat
Poole.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes, I remember now. I wish——”
And then Dave Porter came to a sudden
silence.
</p>
<p>
“What is it, Dave?” and Phil looked closely
at his chum.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, not much,” was the evasive answer.
</p>
<p>
“But I know something is worrying you,” insisted
the shipowner’s son. “I’ve noticed it for
several days, and Roger noticed it, too.”
</p>
<p>
“Roger?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes. He came to me yesterday and said that
he was sure you had something on your mind.
Now, maybe it is none of our business, Dave.
But if I and Roger can help you in any way, you
know we’ll be only too glad to do it.” Phil
spoke in a low but earnest voice.
</p>
<p>
“Hi, what’s doing in the front rank?” cried
a cheery voice at this juncture, and Roger Morr
skated swiftly up beside Dave and Phil.
</p>
<p>
“I’m glad you came,” said Phil, and he looked
at the senator’s son in a peculiar fashion. “I
was just speaking to Dave about how we had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9'></a>9</span>
noticed something was wrong, and how we were
willing to help him, if he needed us.”
</p>
<p>
“Sure, we’ll help you every time, Dave; you
know that,” returned Roger, quickly.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know that I need any help,” answered
Dave, slowly. “The fact of the matter is, I don’t
know what can be done.”
</p>
<p>
“Then something is wrong?” cried both of his
chums.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, if you must know. I was going to keep
it to myself, for I didn’t think it would do any
good to tell about it. I’ll tell you, but I don’t want
it to go any further, unless it becomes necessary
to speak.”
</p>
<p>
“Before you tell us, let me make a guess about
this,” said Phil. “Some of your old enemies are
trying to make trouble for you, is that right?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes.”
</p>
<p>
“And those enemies are Link Merwell and
Nick Jasniff,” cried Roger.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, again,” answered Dave.
</p>
<p>
“What are they up to now, Dave?” The
eager question came from Phil.
</p>
<p>
“They are up to a number of things,” was the
grave response of Dave Porter. “They are evidently
going to do their best to disgrace my
family and myself, and ruin us.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10'></a>10</span><a name='chII' id='chII'></a>CHAPTER II—A GLIMPSE AT THE PAST</h2>
<p>
“Disgrace you and ruin you!” cried Roger,
in amazement.
</p>
<p>
“That is what it looks like,” answered Dave.
“I can account for their actions in no other way.”
</p>
<p>
“Tell us just what is going on,” urged Phil.
“You know you can trust us to keep it a secret.”
</p>
<p>
“I will tell you everything,” answered Dave.
“But first let us skate up a little faster, so that
the others won’t catch a word of what is said.”
And with that he struck out more rapidly than
ever, and his two chums did likewise.
</p>
<p>
To those who have read the former volumes
of this series, Dave Porter will need no introduction.
For the benefit of others let me state
that my hero had had a varied career, starting
when he was but a child of a few years. At that
time he had been found wandering along the railroad
tracks near the town of Crumville. As nobody
claimed him, he was placed in a local poorhouse
and later bound out to a broken-down college
professor, Caspar Potts, who had taken up
farming for his health.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11'></a>11</span>
</p>
<p>
Professor Potts was in the grasp of a miserly
money-lender of Crumville named Aaron Poole,
who had a son Nat, who could not get along at
all with Dave. Mr. Poole was about to foreclose
a mortgage on the professor’s place and sell him
out when something occurred that was the means
of changing the whole course of the professor’s
own life and that of the youth who lived with him.
</p>
<p>
On the outskirts of Crumville lived Mr. Oliver
Wadsworth, a wealthy manufacturer, with his wife
and daughter Jessie. One day the gasoline tank
of an automobile took fire and little Jessie was in
danger of being burned to death. Dave rushed
to her assistance and beat out the flames, and thus
saved her. For this Mr. Wadsworth was very
grateful. He made some inquiries concerning
Caspar Potts and Dave, and learning that Professor
Potts had been one of his former college
instructors, he made the old gentleman come and
live with him.
</p>
<p>
“Dave shall go to boarding school and get a
good education,” said Mr. Wadsworth. And how
Dave went has been told in detail in the first volume
of this series, entitled “Dave Porter at Oak
Hall.” With Dave went Ben Basswood, his one
boy friend in Crumville.
</p>
<p>
At Oak Hall, a fine seat of learning, located on
the Leming River, in one of our eastern states,
Dave made a number of warm friends, including
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12'></a>12</span>
Phil Lawrence, the son of a rich shipowner; Roger
Morr, whose father was a United States senator;
Maurice Hamilton, usually called Shadow, who
was noted for his sleep-walking and the stories he
loved to tell; Sam Day, known throughout the
school as Lazy, why nobody could tell, since Sam
at times was unusually active, and a score of others,
some of whom have already been introduced. He
also made, in those days, one enemy, Gus Plum.
But Gus had since reformed, and was now as good
a friend as any of the rest.
</p>
<p>
What troubled Dave most of all in those days
was the question of his identity. How he started
to find out who he was has been related in my
second volume, called “Dave Porter in the South
Seas.” There he did not meet his father, as he
had hoped, but he did meet his uncle, Dunston
Porter, and learned much concerning his father,
David Breslow Porter, and also his sister Laura,
then traveling in Europe.
</p>
<p>
When Dave came back to Oak Hall, as related
in “Dave Porter’s Return to School,” he met
many of his friends and succeeded in making himself
more popular than ever. But some lads were
jealous of our hero’s success, and two of them,
Nick Jasniff and Link Merwell, did what they
could to get Dave into trouble, being aided in part
by Nat Poole, the son of the miserly money-lender,
who had followed Dave to the school. The plots
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13'></a>13</span>
against Dave were exposed, and in sheer fright
Nick Jasniff ran away and went to Europe.
</p>
<p>
Dave had been expecting right along to meet
his father and his sister, and when they did not
return to this country, and did not send word, he
grew anxious, and started out to find them, as
related in detail in “Dave Porter in the Far
North.” It was in Norway that Dave first
saw his parent, a meeting as strange as it was
affecting.
</p>
<p>
After his trip to the Land of the Midnight
Sun, our hero returned once again to school, as
related in “Dave Porter and His Classmates.”
Jasniff had not returned, but Link Merwell was
still at hand, and likewise the lordly Nat Poole,
and they did what they could to make our hero’s
life miserable. In the end Merwell did something
that was particularly despicable and this caused
Dave to take the law into his own hands and he
gave the bully the thrashing that he well deserved.
Merwell wanted to retaliate in some manner, but
in the midst of his plotting, word of his wrongdoings
reached the head of the school and he was
ordered to pack up and leave, which he did in great
rage.
</p>
<p>
While Dave was off hunting for his father and
his sister, Laura Porter had been visiting her
friend, Belle Endicott, at Mr. Endicott’s ranch
in the far west. Belle was anxious to meet her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14'></a>14</span>
girl chum’s newly-found brother, and this led to a
visit to the ranch, as told of in “Dave Porter at
Star Ranch.” Here Dave again met Link Merwell,
and proved that the latter had been aiding
some horse-thieves in their wicked work. Mr.
Merwell had to settle a heavy bill because of his
son’s actions, and then, for a short space of time,
Link disappeared.
</p>
<p>
With the coming of fall, Dave and his chums
returned to Oak Hall, as related in the volume
preceding this, called “Dave Porter and His
Rivals.” As his chief enemies had left the school,
he did not anticipate much trouble, yet trouble came
in a manner somewhat out of the ordinary. Nat
Poole joined a group of students who had come
to Oak Hall from another school, and the crowd
did what it could to get Dave and his friends off
the football eleven. Then, when Dave had once
more fought his way to the front, came word that
Nick Jasniff and Link Merwell were again “after
his scalp,” as Roger expressed it. Jasniff and
Merwell were then attending a rival institution of
learning known as Rockville Military Academy.
</p>
<p>
“Be careful, or they’ll play you some dirty
trick, Dave,” said Phil, warningly.
</p>
<p>
“I’ve got my eyes open,” replied Dave.
</p>
<p>
In a rather unusual manner Dave had become
acquainted with a man named Hooker Montgomery,
a fake doctor, who traveled around the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15'></a>15</span>
country selling medicines that he made himself.
This man asked Dave to call on him, and when the
youth did so he was suddenly seized from behind,
made a prisoner, and carried off in a sleigh and
then in an automobile. At first he did not know
what to make of it, but at last learned that he was
being held, for some purpose, by Merwell, Jasniff,
Montgomery, and the fourth man, a mere tool.
He watched his chance, and, at length, escaped,
much to his enemies’ chagrin.
</p>
<p>
“Have them all arrested,” was the advice of
Dave’s chums, but this was not easy, since all of
the evil-doers had disappeared. Then, one day,
while on a sleigh-ride to a distant town, the boys
fell in with Hooker Montgomery. The fake doctor
was practically “down and out,” as he himself
expressed it, and said he would do anything for
Dave, provided he was not prosecuted.
</p>
<p>
“It was all a plot gotten up by those two, Jasniff
and Merwell,” said Hooker Montgomery.
“They promised me some money if I would help
them, but I never got a cent.” Then he said that
Jasniff and Merwell were in town.
</p>
<p>
“We’ll locate them,” said Dave, but this was
not accomplished until later, when the pair of
rascals were encountered at a railroad office. Our
hero and his chums tried to stop Jasniff and Merwell,
but the rascals rushed through a crowd and
got aboard a train; and that was the last seen of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16'></a>16</span>
them for the time being. The boys might have
gone after the pair, but they had an important
hockey game to play, and when they administered
a stinging defeat to Oak Hall’s ancient rival,
Rockville Academy, Dave, for the time being, forgot
that he had an enemy in the world.
</p>
<p>
“Two weeks more of the grind, boys!” cried
Dave, on the following Monday. “And then
home for the holidays.”
</p>
<p>
“Right you are,” answered Phil. “But, oh,
those two weeks!”
</p>
<p>
On Wednesday one of Dave’s chums celebrated
his birthday, and among the presents received was
a very fine double-barreled shotgun. This lad
immediately wanted to go hunting; and the result
was that the boys applied to Doctor Clay for permission
to go to Squirrel Island, up the river, on
a hunting expedition, the following Saturday.
There was just sufficient snow on the ground to
make rabbit and squirrel tracking good, and the
boys were told that they might remain away all
day. Six of them had guns and two had revolvers,
and they carried in addition a good-sized hamper
of provisions for lunch.
</p>
<p>
“Now, boys, be careful and don’t shoot yourselves
or anybody else,” said Doctor Clay, with a
smile, when Dave, Roger, and Phil left the school
building. “Don’t fire at anything until you are
certain of what it is. Every hunting season somebody
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17'></a>17</span>
is killed through the sheer carelessness of
somebody else.”
</p>
<p>
“We’ll be careful,” answered Dave.
</p>
<p>
“Do you think you’ll get any game?” And
the doctor continued to smile.
</p>
<p>
“I hope to bring you at least a brace of rabbits
or squirrels, Doctor.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I wish you luck. And don’t stay too
late,” returned the head of the school, and then
with a pleasant nod he dismissed them.
</p>
<p>
Dave, Roger, and Phil were the first at the place
of meeting, but they were quickly joined by all
the others except Ben.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll tell you what, Phil,” said the senator’s son,
when he had a chance to talk to Phil alone.
“Something is wrong with Dave. He isn’t himself
at all. Can’t you see it?”
</p>
<p>
“Of course I can, Roger,” was the reply of the
shipowner’s son. “If I get a chance to speak to
him about it, I am going to do so. But I’ve got
to be careful—I don’t want to hurt his feelings.”
</p>
<p>
“When you do speak, give me the sign, so I
can hear what he has to say, too,” went on Roger,
and to this Phil agreed. Then came the start up
the river, and a little later Phil broached the subject,
and Dave made the dismaying announcement
that Jasniff and Merwell were doing their best
to bring disgrace to himself and his family and
ruin them.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18'></a>18</span><a name='chIII' id='chIII'></a>CHAPTER III—WHAT DAVE HAD TO TELL</h2>
<p>
“It’s rather a long story, and I scarcely know
how to begin,” said Dave, after he, Phil, and
Roger had skated ahead and to the right, where
the others were not likely to overhear the conversation.
“But, to begin with, Jasniff and Merwell
have been to Crumville since they left here
in such a hurry, and—I have some reason to believe—they
have been here in town, too.”
</p>
<p>
“Here!” cried the shipowner’s son.
</p>
<p>
“Yes.”
</p>
<p>
“Why didn’t you tell us of this before?” asked
Roger.
</p>
<p>
“I didn’t know of it until lately, and I didn’t
want to worry you over my private affairs.”
</p>
<p>
“But what have they done?” demanded Phil,
impatiently.
</p>
<p>
“As I said before, Phil, I hardly know how
to begin to tell you. But to plunge right in. In
the first place, when they were in Crumville they
followed my sister Laura and Jessie Wadsworth
to a concert by a college glee club. They forced
their attentions on the two girls, and gave outsiders
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19'></a>19</span>
an impression that they had come as escorts.
The girls were so upset over it that Laura wrote
me that Jessie was actually sick. Two days after
that, when the girls were out walking one evening,
Jasniff and Merwell followed them, and right on
the main street, near the post-office, they came up
and commenced to talk and Merwell said to Laura,
loud enough for half a dozen folks to hear:
’You’ve got to keep your word—you can’t go back
on us like that.’ And Jasniff added: ‘Yes, you
girls were glad enough to let us give you a good
time before, down at the Rainbow.’ The Rainbow
is a ten-cent moving-picture place, and a low
one at that. Of course there wasn’t a word of
truth in it, but Merwell and Jasniff gave folks the
impression that Laura and Jessie had been going
out with them, and you know how such reports
spread in a small town like Crumville.”
</p>
<p>
“The hounds!” exclaimed the senator’s son,
wrathfully. “They should have been run out of
town!”
</p>
<p>
“Why didn’t the girls tell your folks?” asked
Phil.
</p>
<p>
“They did, as soon as they got home, and my
father, Uncle Dunston, and Mr. Wadsworth went
out to look for Merwell and Jasniff, but they were
not to be found. But that was only the beginning.
The next day an old lady came to the house with
a letter she had picked up in the post-office. It
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20'></a>20</span>
was addressed to Link Merwell and had my sister’s
name signed to it, and stated that she was sorry
they had quarreled and wouldn’t he please forgive
her and take her to the dance as promised? Of
course the whole thing was a forgery, and it was
dropped in the post-office just to make talk. I
suppose Merwell thought some chatterbox would
pick it up and spread the news.”
</p>
<p>
“But what is his game?” queried the shipowner’s
son. “I don’t see how he is going to
gain anything by such actions.”
</p>
<p>
“He wants to ruin our reputations, just as he
and Jasniff have ruined their own. But I haven’t
told you all yet. A day later my father heard of
another letter being found, in which Laura and
Jessie promised to go off on a joy-ride in an auto
with Merwell and Jasniff. Then Merwell and Jasniff
appeared in Crumville with a stunning touring
car, and they had two girls with them, loudly
dressed and heavily veiled, and the whole four
tooted horns, and sang, and behaved in anything
but a becoming fashion. A good many folks
thought the veiled girls must be Laura and Jessie,
and you can imagine how my sister and her friend
felt when they heard of it.”
</p>
<p>
“Those chaps ought to be arrested,” murmured
Phil.
</p>
<p>
“And tarred and feathered,” added the senator’s
son.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21'></a>21</span>
</p>
<p>
“After that, my father and Mr. Wadsworth
got after them so sharply that they left Crumville.
That was only a few days ago. The very next
day came a lot of goods to the house, delivered by
a large city department store. The folks hadn’t
ordered the goods and didn’t know what to make
of it. They investigated, and learned that a young
woman calling herself Laura Porter had selected
the things and had them sent out. Then came
other goods for Mr. Wadsworth, said to have
been bought by Jessie. It was an awful mix-up,
and it hasn’t been straightened out yet.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s the limit!” muttered the senator’s son.
“I’ll wager your dad and Mr. Wadsworth would
like to wring those chaps’ necks!”
</p>
<p>
“Wait, you haven’t heard it all yet,” went on
Dave, with a sickly smile. “Yesterday I received
a notice from the express company here to call
for a package on which eighteen dollars was due.
I was expecting some things that I am going to
take home for Christmas presents, although they
were to come to fifteen dollars and a half. I paid
for the package, thinking I had made a mistake
in footing up my purchases, and when I got it
home I found out it wasn’t what I had bought
at all, but a lot of junk nobody can use. Then
my own package came in by the next express, and,
of course, I had to pay again. I sent a telegram
to the city about the first package and they answered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22'></a>22</span>
that David Porter had purchased the same
and had it sent C. O. D. Then two other packages
came, one calling for six dollars and the
other for twenty-four dollars. But I refused to
have anything to do with them, and said I could
easily prove that I hadn’t been to the city to
order them. But it is going to cause a lot of
trouble.”
</p>
<p>
“I believe you,” returned the senator’s son.
</p>
<p>
“Anything more, Dave?” queried Phil.
</p>
<p>
“Yes. Last night, if you will remember, an
old man came to see me. He said that two young
men had sent him to me, saying that we wanted
a man in Crumville to take care of a certain
young lady who was slightly out of her mind. He
said he had once worked in an asylum and knew
he could give satisfaction, even if he was getting
old. It was another of Merwell and Jasniff’s
mean tricks, and I had quite a time explaining to
the old man and getting him to go away. He
said he had spent two dollars and a quarter in
car-fare to come to see me, and I felt so sorry
for him that I gave him five dollars to help him
along.”
</p>
<p>
“Dave, where is this going to end?” cried
Roger.
</p>
<p>
“That is just what I want to know,” returned
Dave. “Perhaps by the time we get back to
Oak Hall there will be more packages waiting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23'></a>23</span>
for me—or potatoes, or a horse, or something
like that.”
</p>
<p>
“You could have Merwell and Jasniff arrested
for this,” was Phil’s comment.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, if I could catch them. But they know
enough to keep shady. But that isn’t all. Yesterday
I got a letter, or rather a note. It was
postmarked from Rocky Run, about fifteen miles
from here. Inside of the envelope was a card
on which was written: ‘We’ll never let up until
we have ruined you.’”
</p>
<p>
“Was it signed?” asked the senator’s son.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, no. But I am sure it came from Merwell
and Jasniff.”
</p>
<p>
“They are certainly sore,” was Phil’s comment.
</p>
<p>
“Traveling around must cost them money.
Where do they get the cash?” asked Roger.
</p>
<p>
“From Mr. Merwell most likely,” answered
Dave. “He got a good price when he sold his
ranch, and he seldom denies Link anything.”
</p>
<p>
“Have you any idea who the girls were who
were in the auto in Crumville?”
</p>
<p>
“Not exactly, but I think they must have been
some of the girls Nat Poole goes with. When
Jasniff and Merwell were there with Nat, I saw
the whole crowd out with some girls from the
cotton mills. They were nice enough girls in their
way, but they were very boisterous and not the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24'></a>24</span>
kind Laura and Jessie care to pick for company.
I suppose those girls played their part thinking
it was nothing but a good joke. One had a hat
on with feathers such as Jessie wears and the
other wore a coat and veil like Laura’s. I guess
a good many who saw them riding in the auto
and cutting up like wild Indians thought they
were Laura and Jessie.” And Dave heaved a
deep sigh.
</p>
<p>
“And what are you going to do, Dave?”
asked Phil, after a short silence, during which the
three chums continued to skate in advance of
their friends.
</p>
<p>
“What can I do? We are trying to locate the
rascals, and when we do we’ll make them stop.
But in the meantime——”
</p>
<p>
“They may cause you no end of trouble,” finished
the senator’s son.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t care so much for myself as I do for
Laura and Jessie, and for Mr. and Mrs. Wadsworth.
I hate to see them suffer because of my
trouble with those rascals. I don’t see why Merwell
and Jasniff can’t fight it out with me alone.”
</p>
<p>
“You forget one thing, Dave,” returned Phil.
“Merwell was once sweet on your sister. I suppose
it made him furious to be turned down by
her.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, then, why does he annoy Jessie? She
never harmed him, or Jasniff either.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25'></a>25</span>
</p>
<p>
“Huh! As if you didn’t know why!” replied
Roger, with something like a chuckle. “Don’t
they both know that Jessie is the very apple of
your eye, and that anything that brings trouble
to her will cut you to the heart? Of course they
know that, Dave, and you can rest assured that
they will try to hurt you quite as much through
Jessie as they’ll try to hurt you direct.”
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps, Roger. If I was sure——”
</p>
<p>
“Low bridge!” shouted Phil at that instant,
as a bend of the river was gained, and then the
whole crowd of students swept under the lowhanging
branches of a number of trees. Those
ahead had to go slowly and pick the way with
care.
</p>
<p>
“How much farther have we to go?” called
out Sam Day.
</p>
<p>
“Only a couple of miles,” replied Dave. He
turned to Phil and Roger. “That’s about all,”
he whispered. “Keep it to yourselves.”
</p>
<p>
“We will,” they replied.
</p>
<p>
“Somebody else going to carry this hamper?”
cried Chip Macklin. “It’s getting rather
heavy.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll carry one end,” said Ben Basswood.
</p>
<p>
“And I’ll take the other,” added Phil. “Dave,
you and Roger go ahead and bring down a couple
of deer, and a bear, and one or two tigers, or
something like that,” he continued, with a grin,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26'></a>26</span>
for he wanted to get Dave’s mind off of his
troubles.
</p>
<p>
“Nothing but an elephant for mine,” answered
Dave, with a forced laugh. “I don’t want to
waste my powder.”
</p>
<p>
“As the society belle said when she left the
mark of her cheek on the gent’s shoulder,” remarked
Buster Beggs, the fat lad of the group.
</p>
<p>
“Say, that puts me in mind of another story,”
came from Shadow. “Once on a time a Dutchman
heard that a certain lady was a society belle.
He wanted to tell his friend about it, but he
couldn’t think of the right word. ‘Ach, she is
von great lady,’ he said. ‘She is a society ding-dong!’”
</p>
<p>
“Wow!”
</p>
<p>
“There’s a ringer for Shadow!”
</p>
<p>
“Shadow, you want to frame that joke and
hang it in the woodshed.”
</p>
<p>
“Put it down in moth-balls until next summer,
Shadow.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, say, speaking about moth-balls puts me
in mind of another story. A man——”
</p>
<p>
“Was it a young man, Shadow?” asked Dave,
calmly.
</p>
<p>
“Maybe it was a very old man,” suggested
Phil.
</p>
<p>
“Was he clean-shaven or did he have a
beard?” queried Roger.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27'></a>27</span>
</p>
<p>
“Never mind if he was young or old, or clean-shaven
or not,” cried the story-teller. “This
man——”
</p>
<p>
“Was he an American or a foreigner?” demanded
Gus Plum. “That is something we have
simply got to know.”
</p>
<p>
“And if he was knock-kneed,” put in Sam. “I
hate love stories about knock-kneed men. They
aren’t a bit romantic.”
</p>
<p>
“Who said anything about a love story about
a knock-kneed man?” burst out Shadow. “I
said——”
</p>
<p>
But what Shadow was going to say was drowned
out in the sudden report of a shotgun,—a report
so close at hand that it made nearly every student
present stop in alarm.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28'></a>28</span><a name='chIV' id='chIV'></a>CHAPTER IV—THE SCHOOLBOY HUNTERS</h2>
<p>
“Dave, what did you shoot at?”
</p>
<p>
It was Phil who asked the question, for he
had been the only one to see Dave raise his shotgun,
take quick aim, and fire into the brushwood
lining the river at that point.
</p>
<p>
“I shot at a rabbit, and I think I hit him,”
was the reply. “I’ll soon know.” And Dave
skated toward the shore, less than twenty yards
away. He poked into the bushes with the barrel
of his gun and soon brought forth a fat, white
rabbit which he held up with satisfaction.
</p>
<p>
“Hurrah!” cried the senator’s son. “First
prize goes to Dave! He’s a fine one, too,” he
added, as the students gathered around to inspect
the game.
</p>
<p>
“Thought you said you wouldn’t shoot anything
less than an elephant,” grunted Buster.
</p>
<p>
“The elephant will come later,” answered
Dave, with a smile.
</p>
<p>
“I’d like to get a couple like that,” said Gus
Plum, wistfully.
</p>
<p>
“Maybe that will be the total for the day,”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29'></a>29</span>
was Sam’s comment. He had gone wild-turkey
shooting once and gotten a shot at the start and
then nothing more, so he was inclined to be skeptical.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, we’ll get more, if we are careful and
keep our eyes open,” declared Dave. “I saw the
track of the rabbit in the snow yonder and that
made me look for him.”
</p>
<p>
Dave’s success put all the students on the alert,
and they spread out on either side of the stream,
eager to sight more game.
</p>
<p>
Less than two minutes later came the crack of
Gus Plum’s shotgun, followed almost immediately
by a shot from Buster Beggs’ pistol. Then a
gray rabbit went scampering across the river in
front of the boys and several fired simultaneously.
</p>
<p>
“I got him! I got him!” shouted Gus, and
ran to the shore, to bring out a medium-sized
rabbit.
</p>
<p>
“And we’ve got another!” cried Sam. “But
I don’t know whether Shadow, Ben, or I killed
him.”
</p>
<p>
“I guess we all had a hand in it,” said Ben.
“We all fired at about the same time.”
</p>
<p>
“What did you get, Buster?” questioned Chip
Macklin.
</p>
<p>
“I—I guess I didn’t get anything,” faltered
the fat youth. “I thought I saw a squirrel, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30'></a>30</span>
I see now that it is only a tree root sticking out
of the snow.”
</p>
<p>
“Great Scott, Buster! Don’t shoot down the
trees!” cried Phil, in mock dismay. “They
might fall on us, you know!” And a laugh
arose at the would-be hunter’s expense.
</p>
<p>
On the students skated, and before long reached
a point where the river was parted by a long,
narrow strip of land known as Squirrel Island,
because squirrels were supposed to abound
there.
</p>
<p>
As they reached the lower end of the island
Dave held up his hand as a warning.
</p>
<p>
“I think I saw some partridges ahead,” he said,
in a low voice. “If they are there we don’t want
to disturb them. Put down the hamper and take
off your skates, and we’ll try to bag them.”
</p>
<p>
His chums were not slow in complying with
his commands, and soon the crowd was making
its way toward the center of the island, where
grew a dense clump of cedars. They had to work
their way through the brushwood.
</p>
<p>
“Ouch!” exclaimed Shadow, presently.
</p>
<p>
“What’s the trouble?” whispered Roger.
</p>
<p>
“Scratched my hand on a bramble bush,” was
the reply. “But it isn’t much.”
</p>
<p>
“Be careful of your guns,” cautioned Dave.
“Don’t let a trigger get caught in a bush or you
may have an accident.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31'></a>31</span>
</p>
<p>
“There they are!” cried Ben, in a strained
voice. “My, what a lot of ’em!”
</p>
<p>
He pointed ahead, and to one side of the tall
cedars they saw a covey of partridges, at least
twenty in number, resting on the ground.
</p>
<p>
“All together!” said Dave, in a low, steady
voice. “Fire as you stand, those on the right to
the right, those on the left to the left, and those
in the center for the middle of the flock. I’ll
count. Ready? One, two, three!”
</p>
<p>
Crack! bang! crack! bang! went the shotguns
and pistols. Then came a rushing, rattling, roaring
sound, and up into the air went what was left
of the covey, one partridge, being badly wounded,
flying in a circle and then directly for Roger’s
head. He struck it with his gun barrel and then
caught it in his hands, quickly putting it out of
its misery. The other boys continued to bang
away, but soon the escaping game was beyond their
reach.
</p>
<p>
“A pretty good haul!” cried Dave, as he and
his chums moved forward. “Three here and the
one Roger has makes four. Boys, we won’t go
back empty-handed.”
</p>
<p>
“Who hit and who missed?” questioned Sam.
</p>
<p>
“That would be a hard question to answer,”
returned Phil. “Better let the credit go to the
whole crowd,” and so it was decided.
</p>
<p>
“Well, there isn’t much use in looking for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32'></a>32</span>
any more game around here,” said Dave. “Those
volleys of shots will make them lay low for some
time.”
</p>
<p>
“Let’s go into camp and get lunch,” suggested
Buster. “I’m as hungry as a bear.”
</p>
<p>
“Were you ever anything else?” questioned
Ben, with a grin, for the stout youth’s constant
desire to eat was well known.
</p>
<p>
They tramped to the south shore of the island,
and there, in a nook that was sheltered from the
north wind, they went into temporary camp, cutting
down some brushwood and heavier fuel and
building a fire. Over the flames they arranged a
stick, from which they hung a kettle filled with
water obtained by chopping a hole through the
ice of the river.
</p>
<p>
“Now, when the water boils, we can have some
coffee,” said Roger, who was getting out the tin
cups. “And we can roast those potatoes while
the water boils,” he added.
</p>
<p>
“What about some rabbit pot-pie, or roast
partridge?” asked Buster.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, let us take all the game back to the
school!” exclaimed Ben. “Just to show the fellows
what we got, you know.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s the talk!” cried Gus. “If we don’t,
maybe they won’t believe we were so lucky.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, let us take it all back,” chimed in Chip
Macklin.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33'></a>33</span>
</p>
<p>
All but Buster were willing to keep the game.
He heaved a deep sigh.
</p>
<p>
“All right, if we must,” he said mournfully.
“But it makes my mouth water, just the same!”
And he eyed the plump rabbits and fat partridges
wistfully.
</p>
<p>
Inside of half an hour the lunch was under
way. Around the roaring campfire sat the students,
some on convenient rocks and others on a
fallen tree that chanced to be handy. They had
brought with them several kinds of sandwiches,
besides hard-boiled eggs, crackers, cheese, some
cake, and the coffee, with a small bottle of cream
and some sugar. They also had some potatoes
for roasting, and though these got partly burned,
all declared them “fine” or “elegant,”—which
shows what outdoor air will do for one’s appetite.
</p>
<p>
They took their time, and during the meal
Shadow was allowed to tell as many stories as
he pleased, much to his satisfaction. It was Dave
who was the first to get up.
</p>
<p>
“Might as well be moving,” he said, after consulting
his watch. “We’ll have to start on the
return inside of two hours, and that won’t give
us much time for hunting.”
</p>
<p>
“Wait, I want just one more picture!” cried
Sam, who had been busy before with his camera.
“Now all look as happy as if to-morrow were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34'></a>34</span>
Christmas!” And as the others grinned over the
joke, click! went the shutter of the box, and the
picture was snapped.
</p>
<p>
“Now, Sam, let me take you, with a gun in one
hand and the partridges in the other!” cried
Dave. “If it turns out well, we can have it enlarged
for our dormitory.” And a minute later
another picture was added to the roll of films.
</p>
<p>
“Why not leave the things here and come back
for them?” suggested Roger. “No use in toting
the hamper and game everywhere.”
</p>
<p>
“We can hang the game in a tree,” added Ben.
</p>
<p>
All agreed to this, and so the hamper and the
game were hung up on the limbs of a near-by walnut
tree along with their skates and some other
things. Then the fire was kicked out, so that it
might not start a conflagration in the woods, and
the students prepared to continue their hunt.
</p>
<p>
“I guess we may as well tramp to the upper
end of the island first,” said Dave, in answer to
a question from his companions. “Then, if we
have time, we can beat up one shore and then
the other. By that time it will be getting dark
and time to turn back to the Hall.”
</p>
<p>
“Say, wait a minute!” cried Ben, suddenly.
</p>
<p>
“What’s wrong, Ben?” asked several.
</p>
<p>
“Why, I—er—I thought I saw somebody over
in the woods yonder, looking at us,” and the
Crumville lad pointed to the trees in question.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35'></a>35</span>
All gazed steadily in the direction but saw nothing
unusual.
</p>
<p>
“Maybe it was a rabbit, or a bear, or something
like that,” suggested Buster. “If it’s a bear we
had better look out,” he added, nervously.
</p>
<p>
“We’ll soon find out,” said Dave. “Come on,”
and he walked forward toward the woods. But
he found nothing and soon rejoined his companions.
</p>
<p>
“I must have been mistaken,” said Ben.
“Come on, if we are to do any hunting.” And
off he stalked, and one by one the others followed.
</p>
<p>
Evidently the shots at the partridges had scared
much of the game away, for at the upper end of
the island they started up nothing but two squirrels
and a few wild pigeons. Then they came
down the north shore and there bagged two rabbits.
They also saw a wild turkey, but it got
away before anybody could take aim at it.
</p>
<p>
“See, it has started to snow!” cried the senator’s
son, presently, and he was right. At first
the flakes were few, but inside of five minutes it
was snowing steadily.
</p>
<p>
“We may as well start for the Hall,” said
Dave. “This storm looks as if it might last for
some time.”
</p>
<p>
They left the shore and soon reached the edge
of the island. By this time the snowflakes were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36'></a>36</span>
coming down so thickly that the boys could see
but little around them. The sky was now growing
quite dark.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t like this,” was Phil’s comment.
“We’ll have no fun of it getting back to school,
especially if the snow gets so deep that we can’t
skate on the ice.”
</p>
<p>
“Say, this puts me in mind of a story,” commenced
Shadow. “Once two boys were caught
in a storm and——”
</p>
<p>
“We haven’t any time for yarns now,
Shadow!” cried Dave. “It’s back to the camping
place as fast as we can get there, and then off for
school, unless we want to be snowed in along the
route!”
</p>
<p>
All started across the island, which, at that
point, was not over seventy-five yards wide. They
came out at a spot just above where they had
stopped for lunch. Soon all of them stood close
to where lay the remains of the campfire, now
covered with the fast-falling snow.
</p>
<p>
“Hello! What does this mean?”
</p>
<p>
“Where is the hamper?”
</p>
<p>
“Where is the game?”
</p>
<p>
“What has become of the skates?”
</p>
<p>
“Where is that overcoat I left on the tree?”
</p>
<p>
These and several other questions were asked in
rapid succession. Then the Oak Hall students
looked at each other in blank dismay.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37'></a>37</span>
</p>
<p>
And not without good reason. For everything
left at the camping spot when they had continued
the hunt—game, hamper, skates, an overcoat, a
sweater, and some other things of lesser importance—all
had disappeared!
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38'></a>38</span><a name='chV' id='chV'></a>CHAPTER V—A TRAMP THROUGH THE SNOW</h2>
<p>
“What do you make of this, Dave?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know what to make of it, Roger—excepting
that somebody has taken our things.”
</p>
<p>
“Do you think it’s a joke, or just plain stealing?”
demanded Ben.
</p>
<p>
“That remains to be found out,” replied Ben.
“One thing is certain, the things didn’t walk off
by themselves.”
</p>
<p>
“Footprints of two persons!” exclaimed Gus,
who had been scanning the snow-covered ground
in the vicinity of the trees and bushes.
</p>
<p>
“Where do they lead to?” asked Dave,
eagerly.
</p>
<p>
“Here they are—you can follow them as easily
as I can,” was the reply, and the heavy-set youth
pointed out the tracks in the snow. They led all
around the trees and bushes and then in the direction
of the river. Here there were a jumble of
tracks and further on the marks of skate runners.
</p>
<p>
“Stopped to put on their skates,” remarked the
senator’s son.
</p>
<p>
“And they have skated off with all our things!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39'></a>39</span>
grumbled Buster Beggs. “What are we going to
do?”
</p>
<p>
“Say, that puts me in mind of a story,” came
quickly from Shadow. “Once two boys were
out skating and——”
</p>
<p>
“For the sake of the mummies of Egypt, let
up on the story-telling, Shadow!” burst out Phil.
“Don’t you realize what this loss means to us?
It’s bad enough to lose the hamper and clothing,
but what are we to do in this snowstorm, with
night coming on, and so far from Oak Hall without
skates?”
</p>
<p>
“Humph! I guess we’ll have to walk,” grumbled
the story-teller of the school. “But that will
take time, and if this storm keeps up——”
</p>
<p>
“We’ll be snowed under!” finished Chip
Macklin.
</p>
<p>
“Well, no use in staying here,” came from two
of the students.
</p>
<p>
“That is just what I say,” said Dave. “Those
skate marks lead down the river and that is the
way we want to go. By following them we’ll be
getting nearer to the Hall and at the same time
closer to the fellows who took our things.”
</p>
<p>
“We’ll never catch those fellows,” grumbled
Ben. “They can skate five times as fast as we
can walk.”
</p>
<p>
“Never mind, we’ll go after ’em anyway,” replied
Gus. “And if we catch ’em——” He did
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40'></a>40</span>
not finish in words but brought his right fist down
hard into his left palm, which left no doubt as
to how he intended to treat the thieves.
</p>
<p>
“Maybe it’s a trick, of some of the Rockville
cadets,” suggested Buster, when the crowd were
on their way down the river.
</p>
<p>
“Say, don’t you remember my saying I thought
I saw somebody near the camp, just before we went
away?” burst out Ben. “You all thought I was
mistaken.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I reckon you were not mistaken,” answered
Dave. “It’s a great pity we didn’t investigate
more before leaving.”
</p>
<p>
“No use in crying over spilt milk,” said Sam.
</p>
<p>
“Which puts me in mind of a sto——” commenced
Shadow, and then suddenly stopped talking
and commenced to whistle to himself.
</p>
<p>
“Say, boys, if anybody should ask you, you
can tell him it is snowing some,” puffed Buster,
who was struggling to keep up with those in front.
“If it wasn’t that we were on the river, it would
be easy to lose our way.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s true,” replied Dave. “The snow
seems to be coming down heavier every
minute.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, and the wind is coming up,” added
Roger. “We’ll have a hard time of it reaching
the Hall. We’ll never do it by supper-time.”
</p>
<p>
“Then where are we going to get something
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41'></a>41</span>
to eat?” demanded Buster. “I’m not going
without my supper just because I can’t get
back.”
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps we can get something at some farmhouse,”
suggested Phil.
</p>
<p>
“I’ve got an idea!” cried Dave. “Why can’t
we get some farmer to hook up a carriage or a
sleigh and take us to the Hall that way?”
</p>
<p>
“Hurrah, just the cheese!” cried Ben, who
did not relish walking such a distance. “The
thing is, though, to find the farmer,” he continued
soberly.
</p>
<p>
“Keep your eyes open for lights,” suggested
Dave, and this was done.
</p>
<p>
A quarter of a mile more was covered, the students
hugging the north shore of the stream, as
that afforded the most shelter from the rising
wind. Then Roger gave a cry.
</p>
<p>
“I think I saw a light through the snow! Just
look that way, fellows, and see if I am right.”
</p>
<p>
All gazed in the direction indicated, and presently
three of the boys made out a glimmer, as if
it came from a lantern being swung to and fro.
Then the light disappeared.
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps it’s some farmer going out to care
for his cattle,” said Dave. “Let us walk over
and see,” and this was done.
</p>
<p>
Dave was correct in his surmise, and soon the
boys approached a big cow-shed, through a window of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42'></a>42</span>
which they saw the faint rays of a lantern.
Just as they did this they heard a voice cry out
in wonder.
</p>
<p>
“What be you fellers a-doin’ in my cow-shed?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, we just came in to rest out of the storm,”
was the answer, in a voice that sounded strangely
familiar to Dave. “We are not going to hurt
your shed any, or the cattle either.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s Mallory, of Rockville!” whispered Dave
to his fellow students, naming the cadet who was
the star hockey player of the military academy
team.
</p>
<p>
“And Bazen and Holt are with him,” added
Phil, gazing through a partly-open doorway, and
naming two other Rockville cadets.
</p>
<p>
“Hello, who’s out there?” cried the owner of
the cow-shed, and, lantern in hand, he turned to
survey the newcomers.
</p>
<p>
“Why, it’s Mr. Opper!” cried Sam. “Don’t
you remember me? I called last summer, to see
some of your young lady boarders.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes, I remember you,” replied Homer
Opper. “You hired my dappled mare for a
ride.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s it, Mr. Opper. Say, that mare could
go.”
</p>
<p>
“Go? Ain’t no hossflesh in these parts kin
beat her,” cried the farmer proudly. “She won
the prize at the last county fair, she did! But
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43'></a>43</span>
wot brung ye here, sech a night as this?” added
Homer Opper curiously.
</p>
<p>
“Hello, Porter, old man!” cried Mallory,
rising from a box on which he had been seated
and shaking hands. “Caught in the storm, too,
eh?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” answered Dave. He gazed curiously at
the Rockville cadet and his companions. “Been
up the river?”
</p>
<p>
“Not any further than this.”
</p>
<p>
“Hunting?”
</p>
<p>
“No, skating. We would be going back, only
Holt broke one of his skates and that delayed us.
Been out hunting, eh? Any luck?”
</p>
<p>
“Some—good and bad. We shot some rabbits,
squirrels, and partridges, and we likewise
had our hamper, our skates, an overcoat, and some
other things stolen.”
</p>
<p>
“Stolen!” cried Homer Opper. “By gum,
thet’s tough luck! Who tuk the things?”
</p>
<p>
“That is what we want to find out,” and as
Dave spoke he looked sharply at Mallory and the
other Rockville cadets.
</p>
<p>
“Not guilty,” came promptly from Bazen.
“Honest Injun, Porter, if you think we touched
your things, you are on the wrong track; isn’t
that so, fellows?”
</p>
<p>
“It is,” came promptly from Mallory and Holt.
Then suddenly the star hockey player of Rockville
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44'></a>44</span>
Academy let out a long, low whistle of surprise.
</p>
<p>
“You know something?” demanded Dave.
</p>
<p>
“Maybe I do,” was Mallory’s slow answer.
“Yes, I am sure I do,” he added. “You can
put the puzzle together yourself if you wish, Porter—because,
you see, I hate to accuse anybody.”
</p>
<p>
“What do you know?”
</p>
<p>
“I know this: Less than an hour ago we met
two fellows on the river, one with a hamper and
the other with a bundle that looked as if it was
done up in an overcoat turned inside out. We
came on the fellows rather suddenly, at a turn
where there were some bushes.”
</p>
<p>
“Our stuff, as sure as you’re a foot high!”
cried Phil.
</p>
<p>
“Who were the fellows, do you know?” demanded
the senator’s son.
</p>
<p>
At this question Mallory looked at Holt and
Bazen.
</p>
<p>
“I wasn’t exactly sure, but——” He hesitated
to go on.
</p>
<p>
“I was sure enough,” chimed in Holt. “They
were those chaps who came to our school from
Oak Hall and then ran away—Jasniff and Merwell.
How about it, Tom?”
</p>
<p>
“I think they were Jasniff and Merwell,” answered
Tom Bazen. “To be sure, as soon as they
saw us, they skated away as fast as they could,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45'></a>45</span>
and kept their faces hidden. But if they weren’t
Jasniff and Merwell they were pretty good
doubles.”
</p>
<p>
“Jasniff and Merwell,” murmured Dave, and
his heart sank a little. Here was more underhanded
work of his old enemies.
</p>
<p>
The farmer and the Rockville cadets were anxious
to hear the particulars of the happening, and
the Oak Hall lads told of what had occurred.
</p>
<p>
“I know those chaps,” said Homer Opper.
“They stayed here one night last summer. But
they cut up so the boarders didn’t like it, so my
wife told ’em she didn’t have no room for ’em,
an’ they left. They ought to be locked up.”
</p>
<p>
“They will be locked up, if we can lay hands
on them,” replied Phil.
</p>
<p>
“They must have followed us to Squirrel Island,
and spied on us,” said Shadow. “Ben, you were
right about seeing somebody. It must have been
either Merwell or Jasniff.”
</p>
<p>
“Have you any idea where they went?” asked
the shipowner’s son.
</p>
<p>
“No, they skated away behind an island and
that’s the last we saw of them,” answered Mallory.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, and I reckon it’s the last we’ll hear of
our things,” returned Buster, mournfully. “But
come on, let us see about getting back,” he continued.
“It’s ‘most time for supper now.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46'></a>46</span>
</p>
<p>
“Mr. Opper, can you take us back to Oak
Hall?” asked Dave. “We’ll pay you for your
trouble.”
</p>
<p>
The farmer looked at the students and rubbed
his chin reflectively. Then he gazed out at the
storm and the snow-covered ground.
</p>
<p>
“Might hook up my big sleigh and do it,” he
said. “But it would be quite a job.”
</p>
<p>
“What would it be worth?” asked Ben.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I dunno—three or four dollars, at
least. It’s a tough night to be out in—an’ I’d
have to drive back, or put up at the town all
night.”
</p>
<p>
“Supposing we gave you fifty cents apiece,”
suggested Roger.
</p>
<p>
“And we’ll go along—as far as Rockville, at
the same price—if you’ll have us,” added Mallory,
quickly.
</p>
<p>
“Why, yes, Mallory, and welcome,” answered
Dave cordially. “That is, if the turnout will
hold us all.”
</p>
<p>
“Sure it will,” answered Homer Opper. “An’
if ye all go an’ pay fifty cents each,”—he counted
them mentally as he spoke—“I’ll hook up my
four hosses an’ git ye there in jig time.”
</p>
<p>
“Then it’s a go,” answered Dave, after his
chums and the Rockville cadets had nodded their
approval.
</p>
<p>
“And do hurry,” called out Buster, as the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47'></a>47</span>
farmer moved away to prepare for the journey.
“We don’t want to miss our suppers.”
</p>
<p>
“Ye ain’t goin’ to miss nuthin’,” called the
farmer.
</p>
<p>
Inside of fifteen minutes he came around to the
cow-shed with a big, low sleigh, to which were
attached four fine-looking horses. The sleigh contained
two lanterns and a quantity of wraps and
robes.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t want ye to catch cold, when we’re
a-drivin’ fast,” chuckled Homer Opper. “Now
pile right in, an’ we’ll be movin’.”
</p>
<p>
The boys needed no second invitation, and soon
all were aboard—Dave and Roger on the front
seat with the driver and the others behind, including
the Rockville cadets. Then came a crack
of the whip, and away through the swirling snow
moved the big sleigh, bound for the two schools.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48'></a>48</span><a name='chVI' id='chVI'></a>CHAPTER VI—GOOD-BY TO OAK HALL</h2>
<p>
“Where in the world have you boys been?
Why didn’t you come back in time for supper?
Don’t you know it is against the rules to stay
away like this?”
</p>
<p>
Thus it was that Job Haskers, the second assistant
teacher of Oak Hall, greeted Dave and his
chums as they came in, after leaving the big sleigh
and settling with Homer Opper.
</p>
<p>
“We are sorry that we couldn’t get here before,
Mr. Haskers,” answered Dave. “But
something unusual happened and we were delayed.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll not accept any excuses!” snapped the
teacher, who had not forgotten how the boys had
hurried away without listening to his call from the
window. “I think I’ll send you to bed supperless.
It is no more than you deserve.”
</p>
<p>
“Supperless!” gasped Buster, in dismay.
“Oh, Mr. Haskers, we don’t deserve such treatment,
really we don’t!”
</p>
<p>
“We have been robbed—that is what delayed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49'></a>49</span>
us,” declared Phil. “I guess we had better report
to Doctor Clay, or Mr. Dale,” he went on,
significantly.
</p>
<p>
“You can report to me,” answered Job Haskers,
with increased severity. “There is no need
to bother the doctor, and Mr. Dale has gone
away for over Sunday.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, boys, back again!” cried a cheery voice
from an upper landing, and then Doctor Clay came
down, wearing his gown and slippers. “A wild
storm to be out in. I am glad you got back
safely.”
</p>
<p>
“They are late—and you said you gave them
no permission to be out after hours,” said Job
Haskers, tartly.
</p>
<p>
“Hum! Did I?” mused the kindly head of
the school. “Well, when it storms like this it, of
course, makes some difference.”
</p>
<p>
“We would have been back in time only we
were robbed of our skates and some other things,”
answered Dave. “We had to walk a long distance
through the storm, and we’d not be here yet
if we hadn’t managed to hire a farmer to bring
us in his sleigh.”
</p>
<p>
“Robbed!” echoed Doctor Clay, catching at
the word. “How was that?” And he listened
with keen interest to what the boys had to tell.
Even Job Haskers became curious, and said no
more about penalizing them for being late.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50'></a>50</span>
</p>
<p>
“And you are sure the fellows were Merwell
and Jasniff?” asked the assistant teacher.
</p>
<p>
“All I know on that point is what Mallory and
his chums had to say,” answered Dave.
</p>
<p>
“I think it would be like that pair to follow
you up,” said Doctor Clay, with a grave shake
of his head. “They are two very bad boys,—worse,
Porter, than you can imagine,” and he
looked knowingly at Job Haskers as he spoke.
“Now go in to supper, and after that, you, Porter,
Morr, and Lawrence, may come to my study
and talk the matter over further.”
</p>
<p>
Wondering what else had happened to upset
the head of the school, Dave followed his chums
to the dining-hall. Here a late supper awaited
the crowd, to which, it is perhaps needless to state,
all did full justice.
</p>
<p>
“Do you think we can track Jasniff and Merwell?”
asked the senator’s son, during the course
of the repast.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t,” answered Dave frankly. “For they
will do their best to keep out of our way.”
</p>
<p>
A little later found Dave, Phil, and Roger in
the doctor’s private study, a sort of library connected
with his regular office. The head of Oak
Hall was reading a German historical work, but
laid the volume down as they filed in.
</p>
<p>
“Sit down, boys,” said Doctor Clay, pleasantly,
and when they were seated, he added: “Now
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51'></a>51</span>
kindly tell me all you know about Merwell and
Jasniff.”
</p>
<p>
“Do you want to know everything, Doctor?” asked Dave,
in some surprise.
</p>
<p>
“Yes,—and later on, I’ll tell you why.”
</p>
<p>
“All right,” answered the youth from Crumville,
and he told of the many things that had
happened, both at the school and at home—not
forgetting about the auto ride in which Laura and
Jessie were supposed to have participated.
</p>
<p>
“It all fits in!” cried Doctor Clay, drawing a
deep sigh. He tapped the table with the tips of
his fingers. “I wonder where it will end?” he
mused, half to himself.
</p>
<p>
“You said that Merwell and Jasniff were worse
than we imagined,” suggested Dave, to draw the
doctor out.
</p>
<p>
“So I did, Porter. I will tell you boys something,
but please do not let it go any further.
Since Jasniff and Merwell became pupils at Rockville
Military Academy and since they ran away
from that institution they have been doing everything
they could think of to annoy me. They
have sent farmers here with produce that I never
ordered, and have had publishers send me schoolbooks
that I did not want. Worse than that, they
have circulated reports to my scholars’ parents that
this school was running down, that it was in debt,
and that some pupils were getting sick because
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52'></a>52</span>
the sewerage system was out of order. Some of
the parents have written to me, and two were on
the point of taking their boys away, thinking the
reports were true. Fortunately I was able to prove
the reports false, and the boys remained here.
But I do not know how far these slanders are being
circulated and what the effect will be in the future.”
</p>
<p>
“And you are sure they come from Merwell
and Jasniff?” questioned Phil.
</p>
<p>
“I am sure at least one letter was written by
Merwell, and one farmer who brought a load of
cabbages here said they were ordered by two young
men who looked like Merwell and Jasniff.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, nobody else would do it!” cried Roger.
“Merwell and Jasniff are guilty, not the least
doubt of it! The question is: How can we catch
them?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, that is the question,” said Doctor Clay.
“I have notified the local authorities to be on the
watch for them, and now I think I shall hire a
private detective.”
</p>
<p>
“Do it, Doctor,” said Dave eagerly. “I will
pay half the expense. I know that my father will
approve of such a course.” And so the matter
rested. The private detective came to Oak Hall
two days later, and after interviewing the doctor
and the boys, said he would do his best to run
down Link Merwell and Nick Jasniff.
</p>
<p>
It snowed hard for a day and a night and when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53'></a>53</span>
it cleared off the boys had considerable fun snowballing
each other and in coasting down a long
hill leading to the river. Pop Swingly, the janitor,
came in for his full share of the snow-balling and
so did Jackson Lemond, usually called Horsehair,
the Hall carryall driver. Horsehair was caught
coming from the barn, and half a dozen snowballs
hit him at the same time.
</p>
<p>
“Hi, you, stop!” he spluttered, as one snowball
took him in the chin and another in the ear.
“Want to smother me? Let up, I say!” And
he tried to run away.
</p>
<p>
“These are early Christmas presents, Horsehair!”
sang out Ben, merrily, and let the driver
have another, this time in the cap.
</p>
<p>
“And something to remember us by, when we
are gone,” added Gus, hitting him in the arm.
Then the driver escaped. He felt sore, and vowed
he would square up.
</p>
<p>
“Maybe he’ll report us,” said Ben, after the
excitement was over.
</p>
<p>
“Not he,” declared Gus. “He’s not that kind.
But he’ll lay for us,—just you wait and see.” And
Gus was right. About half an hour later he and
Ben were told that somebody wanted to see them
at the boathouse. They started for the building,
walking past the gymnasium, and as they did so,
down on their heads came a perfect avalanche of
snow, sent from the sloping roof above. When
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54'></a>54</span>
they clawed their way out of the mass and looked
up they saw Horsehair standing on the roof, snow-shovel
in hand, grinning at them.
</p>
<p>
“Thought I’d give ye some more snow fer
snowballs,” he chuckled. “Here ye are!” And
down came another avalanche, sending the boys
flat a second time. When they scrambled up they
ran off with all speed, the merry laughter of the
carryall driver ringing in their ears.
</p>
<p>
At last came the final session of the school,
with the usual exercises, in which Dave and his
chums participated. Nearly all of the boys were
going home for the holidays, including Dave,
Phil, Roger, and Ben. Dave and Ben were, of
course, going direct to Crumville, and it was arranged
that Phil and the senator’s son should come
there later, to visit our hero and his family and
the Wadsworths. Nat Poole was also going home,
and would be on the same train with Dave and Ben.
</p>
<p>
“I wish he wasn’t going with us,” said Ben.
“I’m getting so I can’t bear Nat at all.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, he isn’t quite as bad as he was when
he chummed with Merwell and Jasniff,” answered
our hero. “I think their badness rather scared
Nat. He is mean and all that, but he isn’t a
criminal.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I think some meanness is a crime,” retorted
Ben.
</p>
<p>
The boys had purchased gifts for Doctor Clay,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55'></a>55</span>
Mr. Dale, and some of the others, and even Job
Haskers had been remembered. Some of the students
had wanted to ignore the tyrannical teacher,
but Dave and his chums had voted down this proposition.
</p>
<p>
“Let us treat them all alike,” said Dave.
“Perhaps Mr. Haskers thinks he is doing right.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, and if we leave him out in the cold he
may be more hard-hearted than ever,” added Gus,
with a certain amount of worldly wisdom.
</p>
<p>
Dave carried a suit-case and also a big bundle,
the latter filled with Christmas presents for the
folks at home. Ben was similarly loaded down,
and so were the others.
</p>
<p>
“Good-by, everybody!” cried our hero, as he
entered the carryall sleigh. “Take good care of
the school until we come back!”
</p>
<p>
“Good-by!” was the answer. “Don’t eat too
much turkey while you are gone!” And then, as
the sleigh rolled away from the school grounds,
the lads to leave commenced to sing the favorite
school song, sung to the tune of “Auld Lang
Syne”:
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Oak&nbsp;&nbsp;Hall&nbsp;&nbsp;we&nbsp;&nbsp;never&nbsp;&nbsp;shall&nbsp;&nbsp;forget,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No&nbsp;&nbsp;matter&nbsp;&nbsp;where&nbsp;&nbsp;we&nbsp;&nbsp;roam;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&nbsp;&nbsp;is&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;very&nbsp;&nbsp;best&nbsp;&nbsp;of&nbsp;&nbsp;schools,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To&nbsp;&nbsp;us&nbsp;&nbsp;it’s&nbsp;&nbsp;just&nbsp;&nbsp;like&nbsp;&nbsp;home!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then&nbsp;&nbsp;give&nbsp;&nbsp;three&nbsp;&nbsp;cheers,&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;let&nbsp;&nbsp;them&nbsp;&nbsp;ring<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout&nbsp;&nbsp;this&nbsp;&nbsp;world&nbsp;&nbsp;so&nbsp;&nbsp;wide,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To&nbsp;&nbsp;let&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;people&nbsp;&nbsp;know&nbsp;&nbsp;that&nbsp;&nbsp;we<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elect&nbsp;&nbsp;to&nbsp;&nbsp;here&nbsp;&nbsp;abide!”<br />
</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56'></a>56</span></div>
<p>
“That’s the stuff!” cried Roger, and then commenced
to toot loudly on a tin horn he carried,
and many others made a din.
</p>
<p>
At the depot the boys had to wait a little while.
But presently the train came along and they got
aboard. Dave and Ben found a seat near the
middle of the car and Nat Poole sat close by them.
He acted as if he wanted to talk, but the others
gave him little encouragement.
</p>
<p>
“Nat has something on his mind, I’ll wager a
cookie,” whispered Ben to Dave.
</p>
<p>
“Well, if he has, he need not bother us with
it,” was Dave’s reply. “I am done with him—I
told him that some time ago.”
</p>
<p>
The train rolled on and when near the Junction,
where the boys had to change to the main line, a
couple in front of Ben and Dave got up, leaving
the seat vacant. At once Nat Poole took the
seat, at first, however, turning it over, so that he
might face the other Oak Hall students.
</p>
<p>
“I want to talk to you, Dave Porter,” he said,
in a low and somewhat ugly voice. “I want you
to give an account of yourself.”
</p>
<p>
“Give an account of myself?” queried Dave,
in some astonishment, for he had not expected
such an opening from Nat. “What do you
mean?”
</p>
<p>
“You know well enough what I mean,”
cried the other boy, and now it was plainly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57'></a>57</span>
to be seen that his anger was rising. “You can
blacken your own character all you please but I
won’t have you blackening mine! If you don’t
confess to what you’ve done, and straighten matters
out, as soon as we get to Crumville, I am
going to ask my father to have you arrested!”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58'></a>58</span><a name='chVII' id='chVII'></a>CHAPTER VII—NAT POOLE’S REVELATION</h2>
<p>
Both Dave and Ben stared in astonishment
at the son of the money-lender of Crumville. Nat
was highly indignant, but the reason for this was
a complete mystery to the other lads.
</p>
<p>
“Blacken your character?” repeated Dave.
“Nat, what are you talking about?”
</p>
<p>
“You know well enough.”
</p>
<p>
“I do not.”
</p>
<p>
“And I say you do!” blustered the bully.
“You can’t crawl out of it. I’ve followed the
thing up and I’ve got the evidence against you,
and against Roger Morr, too. I was going to
speak to Doctor Clay about it, but I know he’d
side with you and smooth it over—he always does.
But if I tell my father, you’ll find you have a different
man to deal with!”
</p>
<p>
Nat spoke in a high-pitched voice that drew
the attention of half a dozen men and women
in the car. Ben was greatly annoyed.
</p>
<p>
“Say, Nat, don’t make a public exhibition of
yourself,” he said, in a low tone. “If you’ve got
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59'></a>59</span>
anything against Dave, why don’t you wait until
we are alone?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t have to wait,” answered Nat, as
loudly as ever. “I am going to settle this thing
right now.”
</p>
<p>
Fortunately the train rolled up to the Junction
depot at this moment and everybody, including
the boys, left the car. Several gazed curiously at
Dave and Nat, and, seeing this, Ben led the others
to the end of the platform. Here there was a
freight room, just then deserted.
</p>
<p>
“Come on in here, and then, Nat, you can
spout all you please,” said Ben.
</p>
<p>
“You ain’t going to catch me in a corner!”
cried the bully, in some alarm.
</p>
<p>
“It isn’t that, Nat. I don’t want you to make
a fool of yourself in front of the whole crowd.
See how everybody is staring at you.”
</p>
<p>
“Humph! Let them stare,” muttered the
bully; yet he followed Ben and Dave into the
freight room, and Ben stood at the doorway, so
that no outsiders might come in. One boy tried
to get in, thinking possibly to see a fight, but Ben
told him to “fly on, son,” and the lad promptly
disappeared.
</p>
<p>
“Now then, Nat, tell me what you are driving
at,” said Dave, as calmly as he could, for he saw
that the money-lender’s son was growing more
enraged every minute.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60'></a>60</span>
</p>
<p>
“I don’t have to tell you, Dave Porter; you
know all about it.”
</p>
<p>
“I tell you I don’t—I haven’t the least idea
what you are driving at.”
</p>
<p>
“Maybe you’ll deny that you were at Leesburgh
last week.”
</p>
<p>
“Leesburgh?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, Leesburgh, at Sampson’s Hotel, and at
the Arcade moving-picture and vaudeville show,”
and as he uttered the words Nat fairly glared into
the face of our hero.
</p>
<p>
“I haven’t been near Leesburgh for several
months—not since a crowd of us went there to a
football game.”
</p>
<p>
“Humph! You expect me to believe that?”
</p>
<p>
“Believe it or not, it is true.”
</p>
<p>
“You can’t pull the wool over my eyes, Dave
Porter! I know you were at Leesburgh last
week Wednesday, you and Roger Morr. And I
know you went to Sampson’s Hotel and registered
in my name and then cut up like a rowdy there,
in the pool-room, and got thrown out, and I know
you and Roger Morr went to the Arcade and made
a fuss there, and got thrown out again, but not
until you had given my name and the name of
Gus Plum. Gus may forgive you for it, and
think it only a joke. But I’ll not do it, I can tell
you that! You have got to write a letter to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61'></a>61</span>
owner of that hotel and to the theater manager
and explain things, and you and Roger Morr
have got to beg my pardon. And if you don’t,
as I said before, I’ll tell my father and get him
to have you arrested.” And now Nat was so
excited he moved from one foot to the other and
shook his fist in the air.
</p>
<p>
To the bully’s surprise Dave did not get excited.
On the contrary, our hero’s face showed
something that was akin to a faint smile. Ben
saw it and wondered at it.
</p>
<p>
“Say, you needn’t laugh at me!” howled Nat,
noting the look. “Before I get through with you,
you’ll find it no laughing matter.”
</p>
<p>
“I am not laughing at you, Nat.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, do you admit that what I’ve said is
true?”
</p>
<p>
“No; on the contrary, I say it is false, every
word of it. Did you say this happened last
Wednesday?”
</p>
<p>
“I did.”
</p>
<p>
“Both Roger Morr and I were at the school
all day Wednesday. During the day I attended
all my classes, and after school I went to my
room, along with Polly Vane, Luke Watson, and
Sam Day, and the three of us wrote on the essays
we had to hand in Thursday. After supper we
went down to the gym for about half an hour,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62'></a>62</span>
and then went back to our dormitory. And, come
to think of it, you saw us there,” added Dave suddenly.
</p>
<p>
“I saw you?”
</p>
<p>
“You certainly did. You came to the door and
asked Luke Watson for a Latin book; don’t you
remember? Luke got it out of his bureau. We
were all at the big table. Sam Day flipped a button
at you and it hit you in the chin.”
</p>
<p>
At these unexpected words the face of the
money-lender’s son fell.
</p>
<p>
“Was that—er—was that Wednesday?” he
faltered.
</p>
<p>
“It certainly was, for we had to hand the
essays in Thursday and we were all working like
beavers on them.”
</p>
<p>
“Nat, what Dave says is absolutely true—I
know he wasn’t near Leesburgh last week, for I
was with him every day and every evening,” said
Ben.
</p>
<p>
“But I got the word from some fellows in
Leesburgh. They followed you from the hotel to
the show and talked to you afterwards, and they
said you told them your name was Porter, and the
other chap said his name was Morr. They said
you gave the names of Poole and Plum just to
keep your real identity hidden.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I am not guilty, Nat; I give you my
word of honor on it.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63'></a>63</span>
</p>
<p>
“But—but—if you aren’t guilty how is it those
fellows got your name and that of Morr?” asked
the money-lender’s son, not knowing what else to
say.
</p>
<p>
“I think I can explain it, Nat. The same fellows
who did that are annoying me in other ways.
But I’ll not explain unless you will give me your
word of honor to keep it a secret, at least for the
present.”
</p>
<p>
“A secret, why?”
</p>
<p>
“Because I don’t want the thing talked about
in public. The more you talk about such things
the worse off you are. Let me tell you that I have
suffered more than you have, and other folks have
suffered too.”
</p>
<p>
“Do you mean to say that some other fellows
did this and gave my name and Plum’s first and
yours and Morr’s afterwards?” asked Nat,
curiously.
</p>
<p>
“Exactly.”
</p>
<p>
“Why?”
</p>
<p>
“For a twofold reason; first to blacken your
character and that of Plum, and, secondly, to
cause trouble between all of us.”
</p>
<p>
“What fellows would be mean enough to do
that?”
</p>
<p>
“Two fellows who used to be your friends,
but who have had to run away, to keep from
being arrested.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64'></a>64</span>
</p>
<p>
“Say, you don’t mean Link Merwell and Nick
Jasniff!” burst out the money-lender’s son.
</p>
<p>
“Those are the chaps I do mean, Nat.”
</p>
<p>
“But I thought they had left these parts.
They were in Crumville, I know,” and now the
bully looked knowingly at our hero.
</p>
<p>
“You have heard the reports from home
then?” asked Dave, and he felt his face
burn.
</p>
<p>
“Sure.”
</p>
<p>
“Nat, those reports are all false—as false as
this report of your doings at Leesburgh. They
are gotten up by Jasniff and Merwell solely to injure
my friends and my family and me. My sister
and Jessie Wadsworth would refuse to even
recognize those fellows, much less go auto-riding
with them. Let me tell you something.” And in
as few words as possible our hero related how
things had been sent to him and his friends without
being ordered by them, and of the other
trouble Jasniff and Merwell were causing. The
money-lender’s son was incredulous at first, but
gradually his face relaxed.
</p>
<p>
“And is all that really so?” he asked, at
last.
</p>
<p>
“Every word is absolutely true,” answered
Dave.
</p>
<p>
“Then Nick and Link ought to be in jail!”
burst out Nat. “It’s an outrage to let them do
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65'></a>65</span>
such things. Why don’t you have ’em locked up—that
is what I’d do!”
</p>
<p>
“We’ve got to catch them first.”
</p>
<p>
“Do you mean to say you are trying to do
that?”
</p>
<p>
“We are.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, you catch ’em, and if you want me to
appear against ’em, I’ll do it—and I’ll catch ’em
myself if I can.”
</p>
<p>
There was a pause, and Nat started for the
doorway of the freight room. But Ben still barred
the way.
</p>
<p>
“Nat, don’t you think you were rather hasty
in accusing Dave?” he asked, bluntly.
</p>
<p>
“Well—er—maybe I was,” answered the
money-lender’s son, growing a bit red.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, let it pass,” said Dave. “I might have
been worked up myself, if I had been in Nat’s
place.”
</p>
<p>
“Here comes the train—we don’t want to miss
it,” cried the money-lender’s son, and he showed
that he was glad to close the interview. “Remember,
if you catch those fellows, I’ll testify
against ’em!” he called over his shoulder as he
pushed through the doorway.
</p>
<p>
“The same old Nat, never willing to acknowledge
himself in the wrong,” was Ben’s comment,
as he and Dave ran for the car steps. The other
boy had lost himself in the waiting crowd and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66'></a>66</span>
got into another car, and they did not see him
again until Crumville was reached, and even then
he did not speak to them.
</p>
<p>
The snow was coming down lightly when Dave
and Ben alighted, baggage and bundles in hand,
for they had not risked checking anything in such
a crowd. Ben’s father was on hand to greet him,
and close at hand stood the Wadsworth family
sleigh, with Laura and Jessie on the rear seat.
The driver came to take the suit-case and Dave’s
bundle, grinning a welcome as he did so.
</p>
<p>
“There’s Dave!” cried Jessie, as soon as he
appeared. “Isn’t he growing tall!” she added.
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” answered the sister. “Dave!” she
called.
</p>
<p>
“Here we are again!” he cried with a bright
smile, and shook hands. “I brought you a snowstorm
for a change.”
</p>
<p>
“I like snow for Christmas,” answered Jessie.
She was blushing, for Dave had given her hand
an extra tight squeeze.
</p>
<p>
“How are the folks?”
</p>
<p>
“All very well,” answered Laura. “What
have you in that big bundle?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, that’s a secret, sis,” he returned.
</p>
<p>
“Christmas presents!” cried the sister. “Jessie,
let us open the bundle right away.” And she
made a playful reach for it.
</p>
<p>
“Not to-day—that belongs to Santa Claus!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67'></a>67</span>
cried the brother, holding the bundle out of reach.
“My, but this town looks good to me!” he added,
as he looked around and waved his hand to Mr.
Basswood. Then Ben took a moment to run up
and greet the girls.
</p>
<p>
“You must come over, Ben,” said Laura.
</p>
<p>
“Why, yes, by all means,” added Jessie, and
Ben said he would. Then he rejoined his father,
and Dave got into the sleigh, being careful to keep
his big bundle on his lap, where the girls could
not “poke a hole into it to peek,” as he put it.
There was a flourish of the whip, and the elegant
turnout, with its well-matched black horses, started
in the direction of the Wadsworth mansion.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68'></a>68</span><a name='chVIII' id='chVIII'></a>CHAPTER VIII—A MERRY CHRISTMAS</h2>
<p>
As my old readers know, the Wadsworth family
and the Porters all lived together, for when
Dave found his folks and brought them to Crumville,
the rich jewelry manufacturer and his wife
could not bear to think of separating from the
boy who had saved their daughter from being
burned to death. They loved Dave almost as a
son, and it was their proposal that the Porters
make the big mansion their home. As Dave’s
father was a widower and his brother Dunston
was a bachelor, they readily agreed to this, provided
they were allowed to share the expenses.
With the two families was old Caspar Potts, who
spent most of his time in the library, cataloguing
the books, keeping track of the magazines, and
writing a volume on South American history.
</p>
<p>
With a merry jingling of the bells, the family
sleigh drove into the spacious grounds. As it
rounded the driveway and came to a halt at the
front piazza the door opened and Dave’s father
came out, followed by Dunston Porter.
</p>
<p>
“Hello, Dad!” cried the son, joyously, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69'></a>69</span>
made a flying leap from the sleigh. “How are
you?” And then he shook hands with his parent
and with his uncle—that same uncle whom he so
strongly resembled,—a resemblance that had been
the means of bringing the pair together.
</p>
<p>
“Dave, my son!” said Mr. Porter, as he
smiled a welcome.
</p>
<p>
“Getting bigger every day, Davy!” was Uncle
Dunston’s comment. “Before you know it, you’ll
be taller than I am!” And he gave his nephew
a hand-clasp that made Dave wince.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, he’s getting awfully tall, I said so as soon
as I saw him,” remarked Jessie, as she, too,
alighted, followed by Laura. By this time Dave
was in the hallway, giving Mrs. Wadsworth a
big hug and a kiss. When he had first known her,
Dave had been a little afraid of Mrs. Wadsworth,
she was such a lady, but now this was past
and he treated her as she loved to be treated, just
as if he were her son.
</p>
<p>
“Aren’t you glad I’ve returned to torment
you?” he said, as he gave her another squeeze.
</p>
<p>
“Very glad, Dave, very glad indeed!” she
answered, beaming on him. “I don’t mind the
way you torment me in the least,” and then she
hurried off, to make sure that the dinner ordered
in honor of Dave’s home-coming should be properly
served.
</p>
<p>
In the library doorway stood Caspar Potts, his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70'></a>70</span>
hair now as white as snow. He came forward
and laid two trembling white hands in those of
Dave.
</p>
<p>
“Dave, my boy Dave!” he murmured, and his
watery eyes fairly glistened.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, Professor, your boy, always your boy!”
answered Dave, readily, for he loved the old
instructor from the bottom of his heart. “And
how is the history getting on?”
</p>
<p>
“Fairly well, Dave. I have nine chapters finished.”
</p>
<p>
“Good! Some day, when it is finished, I’ll
find a publisher for you; and then you’ll be
famous.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know about that, Dave. But I like
to write on the book—and the research work is
very pleasant, especially in such pleasant surroundings,”
murmured the old gentleman.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Wadsworth was away at his office, but
presently he came back, and greeted Dave warmly,
and asked about the school and his chums. Then,
as the girls went off to get ready for dinner, the
men folks and Dave went into the library.
</p>
<p>
“Have you heard anything more of those two
young rascals, Merwell and Jasniff?” questioned
Mr. Porter.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, but not in the way I’d like,” answered
Dave, and told of what Nat Poole had had to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71'></a>71</span>
say and of what had occurred at Squirrel Island.
“Have you heard anything here?” he added.
</p>
<p>
“Did the girls tell you anything?” asked his
father.
</p>
<p>
“Not a word—they didn’t have a chance, for
we didn’t want to talk before Peter.” Peter was
the driver of the sleigh.
</p>
<p>
“I see.” Mr. Porter mused for a moment and
looked at Mr. Wadsworth.
</p>
<p>
“Those good-for-nothing boys have done a
number of mean things,” said the jewelry manufacturer.
“They have circulated many reports,
about you and your family, and about me and my
family. They must be very bitter, to act in such
a fashion. If I could catch them, I’d like to wring
their necks!” And Oliver Wadsworth showed
his excitement by pacing up and down the library.
</p>
<p>
“Did you get your affairs with the department
stores fixed up?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, but not without considerable trouble.”
</p>
<p>
“Have Jasniff and Merwell shown themselves
in Crumville lately?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, three days ago they followed your sister
Laura and Jessie to a church fair the girls attended.
They acted in such a rude fashion that
both of the girls ran all the way home. All of
us went out to look for them, but we didn’t find
them.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72'></a>72</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh, if I had only been at that fair!” murmured
Dave.
</p>
<p>
“What could you have done against two of
them?” asked his uncle.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know, but I would have made it warm
for them—and maybe handed them over to the
police.”
</p>
<p>
“I have cautioned the girls to be on their
guard,” said David Porter. “And you must be on
your guard, Dave. It is not wise to take chances
with such fellows as Jasniff and Merwell.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll keep my eyes open for them,” answered
the son.
</p>
<p>
Dave ran up to his room, and put his big bundle
away in a corner of the clothing closet. Then
he dressed for dinner. As he came out he met
Jessie, who stood on the landing with a white
carnation in her hand.
</p>
<p>
“It’s for your buttonhole,” she said. “It’s
the largest in the conservatory.” And she adjusted
it skillfully. He watched her in silence,
and when she had finished he caught her by both
hands.
</p>
<p>
“Jessie, I’m so glad to be back—so glad to
be with you again!” he half whispered.
</p>
<p>
“Are you really, Dave?” she returned, and
her eyes were shining like stars.
</p>
<p>
“You know I am; don’t you?” he pleaded.
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” she answered, in a low voice. And then,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73'></a>73</span>
as Laura appeared, she added hastily, but tenderly,
“I’m glad, too!”
</p>
<p>
It was a large and happy gathering around the
dining-room table, with Mr. Wadsworth at the
head, and Jessie on one side of Dave and Laura
on the other. Professor Potts asked the blessing,
and then followed an hour of good cheer. In
honor of Dave’s home-coming the meal was an
elaborate one, and everybody enjoyed it thoroughly.
As nobody wished to put a damper on
the occasion, nothing was said about their enemies.
Dave told some funny stories about Oak Hall
happenings, and had the girls shrieking with
laughter, and Dunston Porter related a tale or
two about his travels, for he still loved to roam
as of yore.
</p>
<p>
The next day—the day before Christmas—it
snowed heavily. But the young folks did not mind
this and went out several times, to do the last of
their shopping. Late in the afternoon, Peter
brought in some holly wreaths and a little Christmas
tree. The wreaths were placed in the windows,
each with a big bow of red ribbon attached,
and the tree was decorated with candies and candles
and placed on the table in the living-room.
</p>
<p>
All the young folks had surprises for their
parents and for Professor Potts. There was a set
of South American maps for the old professor,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74'></a>74</span>
a new rifle for Dunston Porter, a set of cyclopedias
for Mr. Wadsworth, a cane for Dave’s
father, and a beautiful chocolate urn for the lady
of the house.
</p>
<p>
“Merry Christmas!” was the cry that went
the rounds the next morning, and then such a
handshaking and such a gift-giving and receiving!
Dave had a new pocketbook for Laura, with her
monogram in silver, and a cardcase for Mrs.
Wadsworth. For Jessie he had a string of pearls,
and numerous gifts for the others in the mansion.
From Laura he received a fine book on hunting
and camping out, something he had long desired,
while Mrs. Wadsworth gave him some silk handkerchiefs.
From his father came a new suit-case,
one with a traveler’s outfit included, and from his
uncle he received some pictures, to hang in his
den. Mr. Wadsworth gave him a beautiful stickpin,
one he said had been made at his own
works.
</p>
<p>
But the gift Dave prized most of all was a little
locket that Jessie gave him for his watchchain.
It was of gold, set with tiny diamonds, and his
monogram was on the back. The locket opened
and had a place in it for two pictures.
</p>
<p>
“You must put Laura’s picture in there,” said
Jessie, “Laura’s and your father’s.”
</p>
<p>
“No, I have them already—in my watch case,”
he answered, and then, as nobody was near, he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75'></a>75</span>
went on in a whisper, “I want your picture in
this, Jessie.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh!” she murmured.
</p>
<p>
“Your picture on one side, and a lock of your
hair on the other. Without those I won’t consider
the gift complete.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Dave, don’t be silly!”
</p>
<p>
“I’m not silly—I mean it, Jessie. You’ll give
them to me, won’t you, before I go back to Oak
Hall?”
</p>
<p>
“Maybe. I’ll see how you behave!” was the
answer, and then just as Dave started to catch her
by the arm, she ran away to join Laura. But
she threw him a smile from over her shoulder that
meant a great deal to him.
</p>
<p>
In the afternoon, Ben came over, with his young
lady cousin, and all the young folks went sleigh-riding.
The evening was spent at the Wadsworth
mansion in playing games and in singing favorite
songs. Altogether it was a Christmas to be long
remembered.
</p>
<p>
During the fall Mr. Wadsworth had been busy,
building an addition to his jewelry works, and on
the day after Christmas Dave went over to the
place with his uncle, to look around. The addition
covered a plot nearly a hundred feet square
and was two stories high.
</p>
<p>
“It will give us a new office and several new
departments,” said the rich manufacturer, as he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76'></a>76</span>
showed them around. “When everything is
finished I shall have one of the most up-to-date
jewelry works in this part of the country.”
</p>
<p>
“Are you going to move the old office furniture
into this new place?” asked Dave, noticing some
old chairs and desks.
</p>
<p>
“For the present we’ll have to. The new furniture
won’t be here until early in January.”
</p>
<p>
“What about your safes?” asked Dave. He
remembered the big but old-fashioned safes that
had adorned the old office.
</p>
<p>
“We are to have new ones in about sixty days.
I wanted them at once, but the safe company was
too busy to rush the order. I wish now that I
had those safes,” went on the manufacturer, in a
lower voice, so that even the clerks near by might
not hear.
</p>
<p>
“Why, anything unusual?” questioned Dunston
Porter, curiously.
</p>
<p>
“I took that order to reset the Carwith diamonds,
that’s all.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, then you got it, didn’t you?” went on
Dave’s uncle. “Were they willing to pay the
price?”
</p>
<p>
“I told them they would have to or I wouldn’t
touch the job.”
</p>
<p>
“What do you suppose the diamonds are
worth?”
</p>
<p>
“They were bought for sixty thousand dollars.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77'></a>77</span>
At the present value of such gems, I should say
at least seventy-five thousand dollars.”
</p>
<p>
“Phew! And the settings are to cost eight
thousand dollars. That makes a pretty valuable
lot of jewelry, I’m thinking,” was Dunston Porter’s
comment.
</p>
<p>
“You are right, and that is why I wish I had
those new safes,” added Oliver Wadsworth.
</p>
<p>
“Can’t you keep the diamonds in some safe
deposit vault?”
</p>
<p>
“There is no very good safe deposit place in
Crumville. Besides, I must have the gems here,
if my workmen are to set them properly. Of
course, I’ll keep them in the old safes when they
are not in the workshop.”
</p>
<p>
“I should think you’d want a watchman around
with such diamonds in the place,” remarked Dave.
</p>
<p>
“I have a watchman—old Tony Wells, who is
as honest as they make ’em. But, Dave, I don’t
want you to mention the diamonds to anybody.
The fact that I have this order is being kept a
secret,” went on Mr. Wadsworth, anxiously.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll not say a word to anybody,” answered
our hero.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t do it—for I am anxious enough about
the jewels as it is. I shall be glad when the order
is finished and the gems are out of my keeping.
I don’t want any outsider to know I have them.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78'></a>78</span><a name='chIX' id='chIX'></a>CHAPTER IX—NAT POOLE GETS CAUGHT</h2>
<p>
In the middle of the week came Phil and
Roger, in the midst of another snowstorm that
was so heavy it threatened to stall the train in
which they arrived. Dave went to the station to
meet them.
</p>
<p>
“Say, what do you think?” burst out Phil,
while shaking hands.
</p>
<p>
“We saw Jasniff and Merwell!” finished the
senator’s son.
</p>
<p>
“You did!” ejaculated Dave. “Where?”
</p>
<p>
“On our train. We walked through the cars
at Melton, to see if we knew anybody aboard, and
there were the pair in the smoker, smoking cigarettes,
as big as life.”
</p>
<p>
“Did you speak to them?”
</p>
<p>
“Didn’t get the chance. The car was crowded,
and before we could get to Jasniff and Merwell
they saw us, ran down the aisle the other way,
and got off.”
</p>
<p>
“Is that so? Evidently they must know we
are on their track,” said Dave, shaking his head
gravely.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79'></a>79</span>
</p>
<p>
“I wish we could have collared ’em,” went on
the shipowner’s son. “I’d like to punch their
heads.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t do it, Phil. If you ever catch them,
call an officer and have them locked up. A thrashing
is wasted on such rascals.”
</p>
<p>
“Do you know some more about them?” questioned
Roger, quickly.
</p>
<p>
“I do.” And then Dave related what Nat
Poole had had to say, and also told about how
Laura and Jessie had been scared when attending
the church fair.
</p>
<p>
“You are right, they ought to be locked up,”
was Roger’s comment.
</p>
<p>
“By the way, did you hear the news from Oak
Hall?” went on Phil, as they drove off towards
the Wadsworth mansion.
</p>
<p>
“What news?”
</p>
<p>
“Somehow or other, the storm lifted off two
of the skylights from the roof of the main building
and the snow got in the garret and there the
heat from the chimney must have melted it, for it
ran down—the water did—through the floor and
loosened the plaster in several of the dormitories,
including ours. I understand all of the plaster has
got to come down.”
</p>
<p>
“What a muss!”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, and it is going to take several weeks to fix
it up—they couldn’t get any masons right away.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80'></a>80</span>
</p>
<p>
“Then where will we sleep when we go
back?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know. I understand from Shadow
that the doctor was thinking of keeping the school
closed until about the first of February.”
</p>
<p>
“Say, that will give us quite a holiday!” exclaimed
Dave.
</p>
<p>
“For which all of us will be profoundly sorry,”
responded Phil, making a sober face and winking
one eye.
</p>
<p>
The girls greeted the newcomers with sincere
pleasure.
</p>
<p>
“What a pity Belle Endicott isn’t here,” sighed
Laura.
</p>
<p>
“So it is,” answered Jessie. “We’ll have to
do what we can to make up for her absence.”
</p>
<p>
Two days later it cleared off, and the young
folks enjoyed a long sleigh-ride. Then they went
skating, and on New Year’s Eve attended a party
given at Ben Basswood’s house. Besides our
friends, Ben had invited Sam Day and Buster
Beggs, and also a number of girls; and all enjoyed
themselves hugely until after midnight. When
the clock struck twelve, the boys and girls went
outside and tooted horns and rang a big dinner-bell,
and wished each other and everybody else “A
Happy New Year!”
</p>
<p>
The celebration on the front piazza was at its
height when suddenly came a shower of snowballs from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81'></a>81</span>
a near street corner. One snowball
hit Dave in the shoulder and another landed
directly on Jessie’s neck, causing the girl to cry
out in mingled pain and alarm.
</p>
<p>
“Hi! who’s throwing snowballs!” exclaimed
Roger, and then came another volley, and he was
hit, and also Laura and one of the other girls.
At once the girls fled into the house.
</p>
<p>
“Some rowdies, I suppose,” said Phil. “I’ve
half a mind to go after them.”
</p>
<p>
“We can’t without our hats and coats,” answered
Dave.
</p>
<p>
Just then came another shower of snowballs
and Dave was hit again. This was too much for
him, and despite the fact that he was bare-headed
and wore a fine party suit, he leaped down on the
sidewalk and started for the corner. Phil and
Roger came after him. Ben rushed into the hallway,
to catch up two of his father’s canes and
his chums’ hats, and then he followed.
</p>
<p>
Those who had thrown the snowballs had not
dreamed of being attacked, and it was not until
Dave was almost on them that they started to run.
There were three boys—two rather rough-looking
characters. The third was well dressed, in a fur
cap and overcoat lined with fur.
</p>
<p>
“Nat Poole!” cried Dave, when he got close
to the well-dressed youth. “So this is your game,
eh? Because Ben didn’t see fit to invite you to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82'></a>82</span>
his party, you think it smart to throw snowballs
at the girls!”
</p>
<p>
As he spoke Dave ran closer and suddenly gave
the money-lender’s son a shove that sent him backwards
in the snow.
</p>
<p>
“Hi, you let me alone!” burst out Nat, in
alarm. “It ain’t fair to knock me down!”
</p>
<p>
By this time Dave’s chums had reached the
scene, and seeing Nat down they gave their attention
to the two others. They saw that they were
roughs who hung around the railroad station and
the saloons of Crumville. Without waiting, Ben
threw a cane to Roger and sailed in, and the senator’s
son followed. Both of the roughs received
several severe blows and were then glad enough
to slink away in the darkness.
</p>
<p>
When Nat got up he was thoroughly angry.
He had hired the roughs to help him and now they
had deserted the cause. He glared at Dave.
</p>
<p>
“You let me alone, Dave Porter!” he
cried.
</p>
<p>
“Not just yet, Nat,” replied our hero, and
catching up a handful of loose snow, he forced it
down inside of the other’s collar. Then the other
lads pitched in, too, and soon Nat found himself
down once more and all but covered with snow,
which got down his neck, in his ears and nose,
and even into his mouth.
</p>
<p>
“Now then, don’t you dare to throw snowballs
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83'></a>83</span>
at the girls again!” said Dave sternly. “It was
a cowardly thing to do, and you know it.”
</p>
<p>
“If you do it again, we’ll land on you ten
times harder than we did just now,” added Ben.
</p>
<p>
“And don’t you get any more of those roughs
to take a hand,” continued Dave. “If you do,
they’ll find themselves in the lock-up, and you’ll
be there to keep them company.”
</p>
<p>
“You just wait!” muttered Nat, wrathfully.
“I’ll fix you yet—you see if I don’t!” And then
he turned and hurried away, but not in the direction
his companions had taken. He wanted to
escape them if possible, for he had promised each
a dollar for aiding him and he was now in no
humor to hand over the money. But at another
corner the roughs caught up to him and made him
pay up, and this added to his disgust.
</p>
<p>
When Dave and the others got back to the
house they were considerably “roughed up,” as
Roger expressed it. But they had vanquished the
enemy and were correspondingly happy. They
found that the girls had not been much hurt, for
which everybody was thankful.
</p>
<p>
“Maybe they’ll lay for you when you go
home,” whispered Ben to Dave, when he got the
chance.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t think they will,” answered Dave.
“But we’ll be on our guard.”
</p>
<p>
“Why not take a cane or two with you?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84'></a>84</span>
</p>
<p>
“We can do that.”
</p>
<p>
When it came time to go home the girls were
somewhat timid, and Jessie said she could telephone
for the sleigh. But, as it was a bright,
starry night, the boys said they would rather walk,
and Laura said the same.
</p>
<p>
In spite of their watchfulness, the boys were
full of fun, and soon had the girls laughing. And
if, under those bright stars, Dave said some rather
sentimental things to Jessie, for whom he had
such a tender regard, who can blame him?
</p>
<p>
On the day following New Year’s came word
from Oak Hall that the school would not open
for its next term until the first Monday in
February.
</p>
<p>
“Say, that suits me down to the ground!”
cried Phil.
</p>
<p>
“Well, I’m not shedding any tears,” answered
Roger. “I know what I’d like to do—take a
trip somewhere.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know where you’d go in this winter
weather,” said Dave.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, some warm climate—Bermuda, or some
place like that.”
</p>
<p>
Another day slipped by, and Dave was asked
by his father to go to one of the near-by cities on
an errand of importance. He had to go to a
lawyer’s office and to several banks, and the errand
took all day. For company he took Roger with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85'></a>85</span>
him, and the boys did not get back to Crumville
until about eleven o’clock at night.
</p>
<p>
“Guess they thought we weren’t coming at all,”
said Dave, when he found no sleigh awaiting him.
“Well, we can walk.”
</p>
<p>
“Of course we can walk,” answered the senator’s
son. “I’ll be glad to stretch my legs after
such a long ride.”
</p>
<p>
“Let us take a short cut,” went on Dave, as
they left the depot. “I know a path that leads
almost directly to our place.”
</p>
<p>
“All right, if the snow isn’t too deep, Dave.”
</p>
<p>
“It can’t be deep on the path, for many of the
men who work at the Wadsworth jewelry place
use it. It runs right past the Wadsworth works.”
</p>
<p>
“Go ahead then.”
</p>
<p>
They took to the path, which led past the
freight depot and then along a high board fence.
They turned a corner of the fence, and crossed
a vacant lot, and then came up to one corner of
the jewelry works, at a point where the new addition
was located.
</p>
<p>
“Now, here we are at the works,” said Dave.
“It’s not very much further to the house.”
</p>
<p>
“Pretty quiet around here, this time of night,”
remarked Roger, as he paused to catch his breath,
for they had been walking fast. “There doesn’t
seem to be a soul in sight.”
</p>
<p>
“There is usually a watchman around, old
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86'></a>86</span>
Tony Wells, an army veteran. I suppose he is
inside somewhere.”
</p>
<p>
“There’s his lantern!” cried the senator’s son,
as a flash of light shone from one of the windows.
Hardly had he spoken when the light disappeared,
leaving the building as black as before.
</p>
<p>
“It must be a lonely job, guarding such a
place,” said our hero, as he and his chum resumed
their walk. “But I suppose it suits Tony Wells,
and he is glad to get the money it brings
in.”
</p>
<p>
“They must have a lot of valuable jewelry
there, Dave.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes, they have. But it is all locked up
in the safes at night.” Dave thought of the Carwith
diamonds, but remembered his promise not
to mention them to anybody.
</p>
<p>
As the boys turned another corner they came
face to face with a fat man, who was struggling
along through the snow carrying two heavy bundles.
</p>
<p>
“Hello!” cried Dave. “How are you, Mr.
Rowell?”
</p>
<p>
“Bless me if it isn’t Dave Porter!” cried Amos
Rowell, who was a local druggist. “Out rather
late, aren’t you?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes.”
</p>
<p>
“So am I. Had to visit some sick folks and
I’m carrying home some of their washing. Goodnight!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87'></a>87</span>
and the druggist turned down one road
and Dave and Roger took the other.
</p>
<p>
Inside of five minutes more our hero and his
chum were at the entrance to the Wadsworth
mansion. Just as they were mounting the steps,
and Dave was feeling in his pocket for his key,
a strange rumble reached their ears.
</p>
<p>
“What was that?” asked the senator’s son.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know,” returned Dave, in some
alarm. “It sounded to me as if it came from
the direction of the jewelry works!”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88'></a>88</span><a name='chX' id='chX'></a>CHAPTER X—WHAT HAPPENED AT THE JEWELRY WORKS</h2>
<p>
“The jewelry works?” repeated Roger.
</p>
<p>
“Yes. What did it sound like to you?”
</p>
<p>
“Why, like a blast of some kind. Maybe it
was at the railroad.”
</p>
<p>
“They don’t work on the railroad at night—especially
in this cold weather, Roger. No, it
was something else.”
</p>
<p>
Both boys halted on the piazza and listened.
But not another sound out of the ordinary reached
their ears.
</p>
<p>
“Might as well go in—it’s getting pretty cold,”
said the senator’s son.
</p>
<p>
Dave unlocked the door and they entered the
mansion. A dim light was burning in the hallway.
While they were taking off their caps and
coats Dave’s father appeared at the head of the
stairs.
</p>
<p>
“Got back safely, did you?” he questioned.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, dad; and everything in the city was all
right,” answered the son. “I’ll bring the package
up to you.”
</p>
<p>
“Never mind—I’ll come down and put it in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89'></a>89</span>
the safe,” answered Mr. Porter. “By the way,”
he went on, “what was that strange noise I just
heard?”
</p>
<p>
“That is what we were wondering,” said
Roger. “It sounded like a blast of dynamite to
me.”
</p>
<p>
“Maybe something blew up at the powder
works at Fenwood,” suggested Dave. The works
in question were fifteen miles away.
</p>
<p>
“If it did, we’ll hear about it in the morning,”
returned Mr. Porter, as he took the package Dave
gave him and disappeared into the library, turning
on the electric light as he did so.
</p>
<p>
The boys went upstairs and started to undress.
Phil had been asleep, but roused up at their entrance.
The boys occupied a large chamber, with
two double beds in it, for they loved to be together,
as at school.
</p>
<p>
“Listen to that!” cried Dave, as he was unlacing
a shoe.
</p>
<p>
“It’s the telephone downstairs!” cried Phil.
“My, but it’s ringing to beat the band!” he
added, as the bell continued to sound its
call.
</p>
<p>
The boys heard Mr. Porter leave the library
and go to the telephone, which was on a table
in an alcove. He took down the receiver.
</p>
<p>
“Yes! yes!” the boys heard him say. Then
followed a pause. “You don’t mean it! When,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90'></a>90</span>
just now? Was that the noise we heard? Where
did they go to? Wait, I’ll call Mr. Wadsworth.
What’s that? Hurry!” Then followed another
pause. “Cut off!” they heard Mr. Porter mutter.
</p>
<p>
“Something is wrong!” murmured Dave.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Porter came bounding up the stairs two
steps at a time. Dave and the other boys met him
in the hallway.
</p>
<p>
“What is it, Dad?” asked the son.
</p>
<p>
“Robbers—at the jewelry works!” panted
David Porter. “I must notify Mr. Wadsworth!”
And he ran to a near-by door and
pounded on it.
</p>
<p>
“What is it?” came sleepily from the rich
manufacturer. He had heard nothing of the telephone
call, being down deep in the covers because
of the cold.
</p>
<p>
“Mr. Wadsworth, get up, get up instantly!”
cried Mr. Porter. “You are wanted at the
jewelry works. I just got something of a message
from your watchman. Some robbers have
blown open your safes and they attacked the man,
but he got away long enough to telephone. But
then they attacked him again, while he was talking
to me! We’ll have to get down there at
once!”
</p>
<p>
“Roger, did you hear that?” gasped Dave.
“That’s the noise we heard!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91'></a>91</span>
</p>
<p>
“Yes, and they attacked the watchman,” responded
the senator’s son.
</p>
<p>
“I’m going back there,” went on Dave. “The
others will have to stop and dress. Maybe we
can catch those rascals.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, and save the watchman, Dave!”
</p>
<p>
By this time Mr. Wadsworth had appeared,
in a bath-robe, and Dunston Porter also showed
himself. Dave slipped on his shoe again and
fairly threw himself into his coat, and Roger
also rearranged his toilet.
</p>
<p>
“Wait—I’ll go with you!” cried Phil.
</p>
<p>
“Can’t wait, Phil—every second is precious!”
answered our hero. “You can follow with the
men.”
</p>
<p>
“Take the gun, or a pistol—you may need it,”
urged the shipowner’s son, as he started to dress.
</p>
<p>
In a corner stood Dave’s double-barreled shotgun,
loaded. He took it up. Roger looked
around the room, saw a baseball bat in another
corner, and took that. Then the boys ran out into
the hallway, where the electric lights were now
turned on full. The whole house was in a hubbub.
</p>
<p>
“We are dressed and we’ll go right down to
the works,” said Dave. “I heard what father
said, Mr. Wadsworth. We’ll help Tony Wells,
if we can.” And before anybody could stop him,
he was out of the house, with Roger at his heels.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92'></a>92</span>
</p>
<p>
“Be careful, Dave!” shouted his uncle after
him. “Those robbers may be desperate characters.”
</p>
<p>
“All right, Uncle Dunston, I’ll watch out.”
</p>
<p>
“If you chance to see a policeman, take him
along. I’ll come as soon as I can get some clothing
on.”
</p>
<p>
Tired though they were, the two boys ran all
the distance to the jewelry works. When they got
there they found everything as dark and as silent
as before. They had met nobody.
</p>
<p>
“How are you going to get in?” asked Roger,
as they came to a halt before the main door.
</p>
<p>
Dave tried the door, to find it locked. “Let
us walk around. The thieves may be in hiding
somewhere,” he suggested.
</p>
<p>
They made the circuit of the works, once falling
into a hole filled with snow. Nothing unusual
met their eyes, and each gazed questioningly at
the other.
</p>
<p>
“It can’t be a joke, can it?” suggested Roger.
“Nat Poole might——”
</p>
<p>
“No, I’m sure it was no joke,” broke in our
hero. “Wait, I’ll try that little side-door. I
think that is the one the watchman generally
uses.”
</p>
<p>
He ran to the door in question and pushed upon
it. It gave way, and with caution he entered the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93'></a>93</span>
building. All was so dark he could see absolutely
nothing.
</p>
<p>
“I guess we’ll have to make a light,” he said,
as his chum followed him. “Wait till I see if
I have some matches.”
</p>
<p>
“Here are some,” answered Roger. “Wait,
I’ll strike a light. You keep hold of that gun—and
be ready to use it, if you have to!”
</p>
<p>
The senator’s son struck one of the matches and
held it aloft. By its faint rays the boys were
able to see some distance into the workshop into
which the doorway opened. Only machines and
work-benches met their gaze. On a nail hung a
lantern.
</p>
<p>
“We’ll light this,” said Dave, taking the
lantern down. “You can carry it, and I’ll keep
the gun handy.”
</p>
<p>
With lantern and gun held out before them,
and with their hearts beating wildly, the two
youths walked cautiously through the workshop.
They had to pass through two rooms before they
reached the entrance to the offices. The light
cast curious shadows on the walls and the machinery,
and more than once the lads fancied they
saw something moving. But each alarm proved
false.
</p>
<p>
“Why not call the watchman?” suggested
Roger, just before entering the offices.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94'></a>94</span>
</p>
<p>
They raised their voices and then raised them
again. But no answer came back.
</p>
<p>
“Would he telephone from the office?” asked
the senator’s son.
</p>
<p>
“I suppose so—although there is another ’phone
in the shipping-room.”
</p>
<p>
The boys had now entered one of the new
offices. Just beyond was the old office, with the
two old safes, standing side by side.
</p>
<p>
“Look!” cried Roger, in dismay.
</p>
<p>
There was no need to utter the cry, for Dave
was himself staring at the scene before him. The
old office was in dire confusion, chairs and desks
being cast in various directions. All of the windows
were broken out and through these the chill
night air was entering.
</p>
<p>
But what interested the boys most of all was
the appearance of the two old safes. The door
to each had been blown asunder and lay in a
twisted mass on the floor. On top of the doors
lay a number of boxes and drawers that belonged
in the safes. Mingling with the wreckage were
pieces of gold and silver plate, and also gold and
silver knives, forks, and spoons.
</p>
<p>
“Here is where that explosion came from,”
said Dave. “What a pity it didn’t happen when
we were in front of the works! We might have
caught the rascals red-handed!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95'></a>95</span>
</p>
<p>
“Listen! I hear somebody now!” exclaimed
Roger. “Maybe they are coming back.”
</p>
<p>
“No, that is my father who is calling!” replied
our hero. “I’ll let him in.”
</p>
<p>
He ran to the office door, and finding a key in
the lock, opened it. Roger swung the lantern, and
soon Dave’s father and his uncle came up, followed
by Mr. Wadsworth, who, being somewhat
portly, could not run so fast, and had to be
assisted by Phil.
</p>
<p>
“What have they done?” gasped the manufacturer.
“Tell me quickly! Did they blow open
the safes?” He was so agitated that he could
scarcely speak.
</p>
<p>
The boys did not reply, for there was no need.
Mr. Wadsworth gave one look and then sank
down on a desk, too overcome to make another
move.
</p>
<p>
“Did you see anything of the robbers, Dave?”
asked his father.
</p>
<p>
“Not a thing.”
</p>
<p>
“And where is the watchman?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know.”
</p>
<p>
“Strange, he must be somewhere around. He
told me of the robbery and then he said that they
were coming after him. Then the message was
suddenly cut off.”
</p>
<p>
“It looks like foul play to me,” said Dunston
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96'></a>96</span>
Porter, seriously. “We had better light up and
investigate thoroughly.”
</p>
<p>
He walked to a switchboard on the wall and
began to experiment. Presently the electric lights
in the offices flashed up and then some of those
in the workshops were turned on.
</p>
<p>
By this time Oliver Wadsworth was in front of
one of the shattered safes. An inner door, somewhat
bent, was swung shut. With trembling fingers
the manufacturer pulled the door open and
felt into the compartment beyond.
</p>
<p>
“Gone! gone!” the others heard him mutter
hoarsely. “Gone!”
</p>
<p>
“What is it?” asked Mr. Porter.
</p>
<p>
“The casket—the Carwith casket is gone!”
And Mr. Wadsworth looked ready to faint as he
spoke.
</p>
<p>
“Were the jewels in it?” questioned Mr. Porter.
</p>
<p>
“Yes! yes!”
</p>
<p>
“All of them?” queried Dave.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, every one. I placed them in the casket
myself before we locked up for the day.”
</p>
<p>
“Maybe the casket is on the floor, under the
doors,” suggested Dave; but he had little hope
of such being the case.
</p>
<p>
All started a search, lasting for several minutes.
But it was useless, the casket with its precious
jewelry had disappeared. Oliver Wadsworth
tottered to a chair that Phil placed for him and
sank heavily upon it.

“Gone!” he muttered, in a strained voice.
“Gone! And if I cannot recover it, I shall be
ruined!”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98'></a>98</span><a name='chXI' id='chXI'></a>CHAPTER XI—LOOKING FOR THE ROBBERS</h2>
<p>
All in the offices listened with interest to Oliver
Wadsworth’s words.
</p>
<p>
“The jewels were probably what the rascals
were after,” was Mr. Porter’s comment. “Evidently
they did not touch any of the gold plate
or silverware.”
</p>
<p>
“That shows they must have known the jewels
were here,” said Dunston Porter.
</p>
<p>
“Couldn’t they find out about them from the
workmen?” questioned Dave.
</p>
<p>
“I suppose so—although it is a rule of the
works for the men to keep silent regarding
precious stones. No one but myself and the general
manager are supposed to know just what we
have on hand.”
</p>
<p>
“We must get busy and see if we cannot follow
the robbers!” cried David Porter. “No use in
wasting time here now. Let us scatter in all
directions. One can go to the railroad station and
the others to the roads leading out of town. We
may pick up some clew.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99'></a>99</span>
</p>
<p>
“The police, we’ll have to notify them!” said
Roger.
</p>
<p>
“Yes! yes! Call the police up on the telephone!”
ejaculated Mr. Wadsworth, starting to
his feet.
</p>
<p>
Dave ran to the end of the office, where a
telephone rested on a stand. The shock of the
explosion had severed the wires.
</p>
<p>
“It’s out of commission,” he said. “I’ll have
to use the one in the shipping-room.”
</p>
<p>
He left the offices, and made his way through
two of the workrooms. Phil went with him and
so did Roger.
</p>
<p>
“This will be a terrible blow for Mr. Wadsworth,”
was the comment of the shipowner’s
son.
</p>
<p>
“He said if he didn’t get the jewels back it
would ruin him,” added Roger.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, we must get them back!” cried Dave.
“Why, they are worth a fortune!”
</p>
<p>
In the shipping-room all was dark, and the
boys had to first light a match and then turn on
the electric illumination. The telephone was near
by.
</p>
<p>
“Ruined!” cried our hero, as he beheld the
wrenched-away receiver and transmitter.
</p>
<p>
“Here is where they must have caught the
watchman while he was telephoning to Mr. Wadsworth!”
said Phil.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100'></a>100</span>
</p>
<p>
“That must be it, Phil. We’ll have to go
to the police station, or find another telephone.”
</p>
<p>
The boys rushed back to the offices and told of
what they had discovered. Then Phil and Roger
volunteered to run to the police station, over a
quarter of a mile away.
</p>
<p>
“If you’ll do that, I’ll go to the railroad station,”
said Dave. “I may be able to pick up
some clew. The twelve-fifteen train is almost due
and those rascals may try to board it. If I see anybody
that looks suspicious, I’ll have him detained.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t get into trouble!” called his father
after him.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll try to take care of myself, Dad,” he answered.
</p>
<p>
Dave ran the whole distance to the depot. As
he went along he kept his eyes wide open for a
possible appearance of the robbers, peering down
side-streets and alleyways, and into vacant lots.
But he saw nobody until close to the station and
then he received a sudden hail from in front of
a coal office.
</p>
<p>
“Hi, you! Where are you going in such a
hurry?” And a man in a dark blue uniform
stepped into view, night-stick in hand.
</p>
<p>
“Just the man I want to see!” cried our hero.
“I guess you know me, Mr. Anderson. Come
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101'></a>101</span>
on down to the depot, quick! We must get there
before the train comes in!”
</p>
<p>
“Why, it’s Dave Porter!” exclaimed the policeman.
“What’s the row, Dave?”
</p>
<p>
“Mr. Wadsworth’s jewelry works has been
robbed. They have just gone to notify headquarters.
I thought maybe the robbers might try
to get away on the train. We want to stop any
suspicious characters.”
</p>
<p>
“The jewelry works robbed? You don’t say!
All right, I’ll go right along. Hope we can catch
’em!” And Officer Anderson swung up beside
Dave, and both continued on a dog-trot to the
depot.
</p>
<p>
Nobody but the station master was in sight.
Dave and the policeman thought it best to keep
out of sight.
</p>
<p>
“You stay at one end and I’ll stay at the other,”
said the officer. “If you see anybody suspicious,
whistle twice and I’ll come on the double-quick.”
</p>
<p>
At last they heard the train coming. Nobody
had appeared, but presently Dave caught sight of
a burly figure sneaking beside several empty
freight cars on a side-track. He gave the signal
for aid and then sneaked after the man. By this
time the train had rolled into the little station.
</p>
<p>
Only a well-known young man of Crumville
alighted, accompanied by an elderly lady, his
mother. There were no passengers to get aboard,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102'></a>102</span>
and the conductor swung his lantern for the engineer
to go ahead again.
</p>
<p>
At that moment the burly fellow near the freight
cars made a dive for the trucks of a baggage car,
with the evident intention of stealing a ride. He
had almost reached the trucks when Dave came
up behind him and hauled him back.
</p>
<p>
“Not so fast!” said our hero, firmly. “I
want to talk to you.”
</p>
<p>
“Hey, you let me alone!” growled the burly
fellow. He was ragged and unshaven and evidently
a tramp.
</p>
<p>
“Where did you come from?” went on Dave,
and he continued to hold the man, while the train
moved off.
</p>
<p>
“Wot business is that o’ yours?” was the
sulky return. “Wot did yer make me miss that
train for?”
</p>
<p>
“You’ll find out in a minute or two,” answered
our hero, and just then Officer Anderson came running
up.
</p>
<p>
“Got somebody, have you?” he panted.
</p>
<p>
“I guess he is only a tramp,” was Dave’s reply.
“But we may as well hold him and see what he
has got to say.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s Applejack Joe,” said the policeman, as he
eyed the prisoner. “We warned him out of town
this morning. What was he going to do, steal
a ride?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103'></a>103</span>
</p>
<p>
“I think so. I caught him making for the
trucks of a baggage car.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s Joe’s favorite way of riding,” chuckled
the policeman.
</p>
<p>
“I can’t see why that young feller had to stop
me,” growled the tramp. “You folks wants me
to git out, an’ when I start yer hold me back.”
</p>
<p>
“Why didn’t you go this morning, if you were
told to go?” asked Dave.
</p>
<p>
“Say, I don’t move as swift as some folks.
Wot’s the use? Take yer time, is my motter.”
</p>
<p>
“Where have you been for the last three or
four hours?” asked the policeman.
</p>
<p>
“Where have I been? It won’t do you no
good to know, cap’n.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, you tell us, just the same,” said Dave.
“I want to know if you have seen any other men
sneaking around town to-night. If you have, it
may pay you to tell me about it.”
</p>
<p>
“Provided we can land on those other chaps,”
put in the officer.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I see; somethin’ wrong, hey?” And the
tramp leered unpleasantly. “Want to pull me
into it, mebbe.”
</p>
<p>
“You are pulled in already,” answered Officer
Anderson.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, don’t arrest me, an’ I’ll tell you everything
I know!” pleaded Applejack Joe. He had
once been in the Crumville jail in winter and found
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104'></a>104</span>
it very cold and uninviting, and he wanted no more
of it.
</p>
<p>
“What do you know?” questioned Dave.
“Answer quick. There has been a big robbery
here, and if you can help us to catch the men maybe
you’ll get a reward.”
</p>
<p>
“Reward? Say, I’m your huckleberry, young
man. Wot do I know?” The tramp rubbed his
unshaven chin. “Yes, that’s them, I’m sure of
it,” he murmured, half to himself.
</p>
<p>
“Who?” demanded Dave, impatiently.
</p>
<p>
“Them two fellers I see down at Casterbury’s
stock-farm this afternoon. They had a bag wot
looked suspicious to me, an’, say; did they use
dynamite, or somethin’ like that?”
</p>
<p>
“They did!”
</p>
<p>
“Then that’s them! Cos why? Cos when they
walked past where I was hidin’, I heard one of ’em
say, ‘Be careful o’ that, we don’t want it to go
off an’ git blowed up.’”
</p>
<p>
“Two men?” came from the policeman.
“Did you know them?”
</p>
<p>
The tramp shook his head.
</p>
<p>
“Never set eyes on ’em before. But I see ’em
after that, down back of that jewelry works over
there,” and he threw up his hand in the direction
of Mr. Wadsworth’s place. “Say, is that
the place they robbed?” he continued, with some
show of interest.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105'></a>105</span>
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” answered Dave. “Now tell me how
those fellows looked.”
</p>
<p>
“I can’t tell yer that, exactly, fer my eyesight
ain’t none too good, I git so much smoke an’ cinders
in ’em from the railroad. But they was
kinder young fellers, I think, and putty good educated—not
common fellers like me. Somethin’
like yerself. An’ they was dressed putty good,
long overcoats, and soft hats wot was pulled down
over their faces.”
</p>
<p>
“Did you hear them speak any names?” asked
Officer Anderson.
</p>
<p>
“Nary a name.”
</p>
<p>
“Have you seen the two men during the last
hour or so?” asked Dave.
</p>
<p>
“No, ain’t see ’em since I spotted ’em back
of the jewelry factory. That was about seven,
or maybe eight o’clock.”
</p>
<p>
“Did they go into the works then?”
</p>
<p>
“No, they just stood by the back fence talkin’.
I thought they had somethin’ to do with that new
buildin’ going up there, so I didn’t think nuthin’
more about it.”
</p>
<p>
“I see. Well, Joe, I guess you had better come
with us for the present,” went on Dave. “We’ll
want your testimony.”
</p>
<p>
“It ain’t fair to arrest me!” whined the tramp.
</p>
<p>
“We won’t call it arrest,” went on Dave, before
the policeman could speak. “You’ll be detained, that’s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106'></a>106</span>
all, and I’ll see that you don’t lose
anything by it.”
</p>
<p>
“All right then, if that’s the way you’re goin’
to put it,” answered Applejack Joe resignedly.
“But I hope you’ll see to it that I gits something
to eat an’ a warm place to sleep.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll remember,” returned our hero.
</p>
<p>
There seemed nothing now to do but to return
to the jewelry works and this Dave did, taking
the tramp and the officer with him. When they
arrived they found the chief of police there, with
two officers. The chief was questioning Mr.
Wadsworth and the distracted manufacturer was
telling what he knew about the crime that had
been committed.
</p>
<p>
The arrival of those from the depot, and what
the tramp had to tell, put a new face on the matter.
One of the officers said he had seen the two
strangers with the tool-bag, but had put them down
for traveling salesmen visiting Crumville on business.
</p>
<p>
“They are undoubtedly the guilty parties,” said
the chief. “The only question is: Where did they
go to?”
</p>
<p>
“Well, they didn’t take that twelve-fifteen
train,” answered Dave.
</p>
<p>
“Then they either got out of town by the use
of a horse or an auto, or else they are here yet,”
said Mr. Wadsworth. “Oh, catch them! Catch
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107'></a>107</span>
them if you can! I must get those jewels back!
I’ll give a big reward for their safe return.”
</p>
<p>
“Have you heard from Phil or Roger yet?”
</p>
<p>
“No, Dave.”
</p>
<p>
“They may bring in some word.”
</p>
<p>
“Let us hope so,” groaned the manufacturer.
</p>
<p>
“What became of the watchman?”
</p>
<p>
“That is a mystery. Perhaps they carried him
off and threw him into the river, or something
like that!”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, they wouldn’t be as rascally as all that!”
returned Dave, in horror.
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps. Some robbers are very desperate
characters.”
</p>
<p>
At that moment came a cry from one of the
workrooms, where one of the officers had gone to
take a look around.
</p>
<p>
“What is it, Carr?” called the chief of police.
</p>
<p>
“Here’s poor Tony Wells,” was the answer.
“He’s in bad shape. Better somebody run for
a doctor at once!”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108'></a>108</span><a name='chXII' id='chXII'></a>CHAPTER XII—THE TELLTALE CIGARETTE BOX</h2>
<p>
The watchman was indeed in bad shape. He
had been found thrown under a workbench, and
just returning to consciousness. He had a cut
over his left ear and another on his forehead, from
which the blood had flowed freely.
</p>
<p>
“Must have struck him with a club, or an
iron bar,” was the opinion of the chief, as the
injured man was carried into the office and placed
on some chair cushions. Here his wounds were
washed and bound up, while one officer ran to
get a doctor who lived not a great distance off.
</p>
<p>
It was some little time before Tony Wells,
who was nearly seventy years of age, opened his
eyes to stare around him.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t—don’t hit me again!” he murmured.
“I—I didn’t touch you!”
</p>
<p>
“It’s all right, Tony!” said the chief. “Those
fellows are gone. You’re among friends.”
</p>
<p>
“They—knocked me down!” gasped the old
watchman. “I—I—tried to telephone—after the
explosion, but—but——” He could not go on,
and suddenly relapsed again into unconsciousness.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109'></a>109</span>
</p>
<p>
“Poor fellow!” said Mr. Wadsworth, tenderly.
“We must do what we can for him.”
</p>
<p>
“Is anything missing besides the jewels?”
asked Dave, while they were waiting for the doctor
to come, and waiting to hear from the others who
had gone out.
</p>
<p>
“No, Dave. But that is enough. If they are
not recovered, I shall be ruined.”
</p>
<p>
“Can they hold you responsible for the loss?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, for when I took the jewels to re-set I
guaranteed the safe return of each jewel. I had
to do that because they were afraid some workmen
might try to substitute other jewels not so
good—which is sometimes done.”
</p>
<p>
“And you said they were worth seventy-five
thousand dollars?”
</p>
<p>
“All of that.”
</p>
<p>
“Those robbers certainly made a haul.”
</p>
<p>
“It drives me crazy to think about it,” groaned
Oliver Wadsworth.
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps the others who went out will catch
them,” answered our hero, hopefully.
</p>
<p>
Soon the doctor arrived and took charge of old
Tony Wells, whom he knew well. As Wells was
a widower, living alone, the doctor said he would
take the old man to his own home, where he
could have constant attention.
</p>
<p>
“He is already in a fever,” said the physician.
“We had better not try to question him at present.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110'></a>110</span>
It will only excite him the more.” And a
little later the sufferer was placed on a litter and
carried to the doctor’s residence.
</p>
<p>
By this time the news was circulating that the
Wadsworth jewelry works had been robbed, and
many persons spent the rest of the night looking
for the two young men who were supposed to be
guilty of the crime. Oliver Wadsworth and an
officer remained at the offices, guarding the
wrecked place and looking for clews of the evildoers.
But nothing in the way of evidence against
the robbers was brought to light, excepting that
they had used several drills and some dynamite
on the two old safes, probably blowing them up
simultaneously. They had taken the tool-bag with
its contents with them and also another small
valise, belonging to one of Mr. Wadsworth’s
traveling salesmen.
</p>
<p>
“I can’t understand why Tony Wells didn’t discover
them when they first came in,” said
Dave.
</p>
<p>
“Maybe he did and they made him a prisoner,”
suggested Mr. Wadsworth. “Tony was very
faithful—the best watchman I ever had.”
</p>
<p>
Daylight came at last and still the search for the
two robbers was kept up. In the meantime, telegrams
and telephone messages had been sent in
all directions. To stimulate the searchers Mr.
Wadsworth offered a reward of one thousand dollars
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111'></a>111</span>
for the recovery of the jewels and this reward
was later on increased to five thousand dollars.
</p>
<p>
When Tony Wells was well enough to tell his
story he said he had been going the rounds of the
works when he suddenly found himself confronted
by two masked men. He had started to cry out
and run for help when the men had seized him
and thrown him down and bound him fast to a
work-bench. Then the men had gone to the offices,
and later on had come the explosion. He knew
they were blowing open the safes and did what
he could to free himself. At last he managed to
get free, but found himself too weak to run for
help. He had dragged himself to the telephone in
the shipping-room and was sending his message to
Mr. Wadsworth when the masked men had again
appeared and knocked him down. That was all
he remembered until the time he was found, as
already described.
</p>
<p>
“You did not see the faces of the two men?”
asked Oliver Wadsworth.
</p>
<p>
“No, sir, they were all covered with black
masks. But I think the fellows was rather young-like,”
answered the old watchman. “Both of
’em was about the size of Dave Porter,—but
neither of ’em was Dave,—I know that by the
voices,” he went on, hastily.
</p>
<p>
“No, Dave was at home with me,” said Oliver
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112'></a>112</span>
Wadsworth. “But he and one of his friends
passed the works just before the explosion.”
</p>
<p>
The news of the robbery had upset the Wadsworth
household completely. Mrs. Wadsworth
was as much distressed as her husband, and Jessie
was as pale as if seriously ill.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Dave, supposing the jewels are not recovered!”
said Jessie, when they met in the hallway.
“It will ruin father,—I heard him tell
mamma so!”
</p>
<p>
“We are going to get them back—we’ve simply
got to do it,” Dave replied.
</p>
<p>
“But how? Nobody seems to know what has
become of the robbers.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, just wait, Jessie. We are sure to get
some trace of them sooner or later.”
</p>
<p>
“What makes you so hopeful, Dave?” and
now the girl suddenly clutched his arm. “Have
you a clew?”
</p>
<p>
“I think so, but I am not sure. I am going
to talk to your father about it, and then I am going
to take another look around Crumville and around
the offices.”
</p>
<p>
Dave’s father and his Uncle Dunston had been
out all day, and so had Phil and Roger and Ben,
and a score of others, including the officers of the
law. But nothing had been seen or heard of the
mysterious men with the tool-bag. Another tramp
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113'></a>113</span>
had been rounded up, but he knew absolutely
nothing of the crime and was let go again.
</p>
<p>
Oliver Wadsworth’s face was white and drawn
and he looked as if he had suddenly grown five
years older. He had a long, private conversation
with Dave’s father and Dunston Porter, and all
three men looked very grave when the conference
came to an end.
</p>
<p>
There was good cause for this seriousness. The
new addition to the jewelry works had placed Mr.
Wadsworth in debt. The Porters had lent him
twenty thousand dollars, and, just then, could lend
him no more, having a number of obligations of
their own to meet.
</p>
<p>
The Carwith jewels were the property of Mr.
and Mrs. Ridgeway Osgood Carwith, of Fifth
Avenue, New York City. The Carwiths were now
on a trip around the world, but were expected
home some time in the spring. Mr. Wadsworth
had agreed to re-set the jewels according to designs
already accepted by the millionaire and his
wife, and had guaranteed the safe return of the
jewels, re-set as specified, not later than the first
of the following May. As the millionaire was a
strict business man he had demanded a bond for
the safe return of his property, and this bond had
been given by Mr. Wadsworth, indorsed by David
Breslow Porter and Dunston Porter.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114'></a>114</span>
</p>
<p>
Thus it will readily be seen that the millionaire
and his wife were amply secured. If they did not
get the jewels back they would demand the payment
of the bond, worth seventy-five thousand dollars,
and Mr. Wadsworth and the Porters would
have to make good.
</p>
<p>
On the second day after the robbery, Dave,
Roger, and Phil went down to the jewelry works
and began a close investigation on their own account.
Dave had mentioned something to his
chums that had caused them to open their eyes in
astonishment.
</p>
<p>
An hour was spent around the offices, and then
Phil picked up an empty cigarette case. He took
it to Dave and Roger and both looked at it with
keen interest.
</p>
<p>
“I guess that is another clew,” said our hero.
“Let us look around some more.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m going for the train now,” said the senator’s
son, a little later. “And as soon as I find
Hooker Montgomery I’ll let you know.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, and make him come here, whether he
wants to or not,” cried Dave.
</p>
<p>
“You leave that to me,” answered Roger,
grimly.
</p>
<p>
Oliver Wadsworth had been interviewing a
private detective, and soon the man left, stating
he thought he could lay his hands on the guilty
parties.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115'></a>115</span>
</p>
<p>
“I’ll look for Tom Basnett,” said the detective.
“This looks like one of his jobs.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t care whose job it is—I want the jewels
back,” said Mr. Wadsworth, wearily. He had
not slept since the crime had been committed.
</p>
<p>
“Mr. Wadsworth, Phil and I would like to
talk to you in private,” said Dave, when he could
get the chance.
</p>
<p>
“You have some clew, Dave?”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I want to tell you something, and then
you can judge for yourself.”
</p>
<p>
“Very well, come with me,” answered the
manufacturer, and led the way to a little side-room,
used by the salesmen for exhibiting wares to possible
customers.
</p>
<p>
“I want to tell you all about something that
happened early in the winter, while I was at Oak
Hall,” said Dave. And then he told of how he
had called on the fake doctor, Hooker Montgomery,
and how he had been attacked from behind
and made a prisoner, and carried off to a
house in the woods, the particulars of which have
already been set down in “Dave Porter and His
Rivals.”
</p>
<p>
“The fellows who carried me off were the doctor
and the driver, who was only a tool, and two
fellows who have caused me a lot of trouble in
the past, Nick Jasniff and Link Merwell,” went
on our hero. “When I got away I tried to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116'></a>116</span>
follow up Jasniff and Merwell, but they got
away from me, and so did the driver get away.
But one day I found Hooker Montgomery,
and by threatening to have him arrested I made
him confess to the truth, which was that Jasniff
and Merwell had hired him to help get me in
their power. At first they told Montgomery it
was only a schoolboy trick, and he said he believed
them, but, later on, it leaked out that Jasniff and
Merwell had another motive in making me a
prisoner.”
</p>
<p>
“And that motive——?” began Oliver Wadsworth,
with deep interest.
</p>
<p>
“Doctor Montgomery said that Jasniff and
Merwell had in mind to drug me and take me to
some place a good distance from Oak Hall. He
said he also heard them speak of robbing a jewelry
works, and I was to be drugged and left in the
factory,—to make it appear as if I had done the
deed and as if the blowing up of a safe had stunned
me.”
</p>
<p>
“Dave, is this possible!” exclaimed the manufacturer.
</p>
<p>
“It is true, Mr. Wadsworth,” said Phil. “I
was along and so was Roger at the time. Montgomery
couldn’t give many details, but he said
he thought Jasniff and Merwell were cold-blooded
villains and he wanted nothing more to do with
them.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117'></a>117</span>
</p>
<p>
“This looks as if those rascals, Jasniff and
Merwell, had come here.”
</p>
<p>
“I believe they did come,” went on Dave.
“And here is one clew we have already picked up
against them.” And he held up the empty cigarette
box.
</p>
<p>
“What is that? Only a cigarette box. How
can that be a clew?”
</p>
<p>
“I will tell you. Both Jasniff and Merwell are
inveterate cigarette smokers. I have seen them
smoking many times. They smoke a Turkish
brand of cigarettes, having a peculiar blue and
gold band around the box. This is the same kind
of a box, and I am convinced that this box was
emptied and thrown away in your offices by Jasniff
or Merwell.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118'></a>118</span><a name='chXIII' id='chXIII'></a>CHAPTER XIII—DARK DAYS</h2>
<p>
Oliver Wadsworth listened to Dave’s words
with deep interest. Then he shrugged his shoulders.
</p>
<p>
“That sounds pretty good, Dave, were it not
for one thing. Do you imagine that two masked
fellows, bent on blowing open safes, would stop
to light and smoke cigarettes?”
</p>
<p>
“I think Merwell and Jasniff would, Merwell
especially. When Link is nervous the first thing
he does is to take out a cigarette and light it. It’s
an almost unconscious habit with him.”
</p>
<p>
“This story about what that doctor said interests
me most of all,” went on the manufacturer.
“I think we ought to have a talk with him. For
all we know, he may be one of the guilty parties.”
</p>
<p>
“No, I don’t think he is that kind. Besides,
he was very angry at Merwell and Jasniff and
wanted nothing more to do with them.”
</p>
<p>
“The detective who was here thought he had
a clew against a professional bank burglar. Personally,
I think this looks more like the work of
professionals than fellows just out of school,” said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119'></a>119</span>
the manufacturer; and there, for the time being,
the matter rested.
</p>
<p>
During the day two more detectives appeared
and went over the ground, as the other officials had
done. One thought he saw in the robbery the
hand of a criminal known as Red Andrews.
</p>
<p>
“This is just the way Red Andrews would go
at a job,” said the detective. “He was sent up
for robbing a private banker some years ago, and
he got out two months ago. He was in New York—I
saw him on Fifth Avenue, not far from the
Carwith mansion. He may have heard about the
jewels there. I am going to look for him.” And
he departed on a hunt for Red Andrews.
</p>
<p>
It was not until two days later that Roger came
back to Crumville. His face showed his disappointment.
</p>
<p>
“Such mean luck!” he exclaimed, when he met
Dave, Phil, and Ben. “I went to four towns,
looking for Hooker Montgomery, and at last I
found out that he had left the east several days
ago.”
</p>
<p>
“Where did he go to?” questioned our hero.
</p>
<p>
“The folks I met couldn’t tell exactly,
but they thought to visit a rich aunt in the far
west.”
</p>
<p>
This was a great disappointment, for they had
hoped to learn much more concerning the plans
of Jasniff and Merwell, from the fake doctor.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120'></a>120</span>
</p>
<p>
“We might send him a letter, to his last residence.
Maybe the post-office authorities will forward
it,” suggested Phil.
</p>
<p>
“I did that,” answered the senator’s son. “I
told him that I wanted to hear from him at once,
and that it would be money in his pocket to write
or to telegraph to me. I didn’t mention your
name, Dave, for I thought he might hear of this
robbery and get suspicious.”
</p>
<p>
It was ideal weather for skating and sleighing,
but none of the young folks at the Wadsworth
mansion felt like going out for fun. All could
see that the older folks were much worried, and
consequently, they were worried, too.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Dave, what if those jewels are never recovered?”
said Laura to her brother, when they
were alone. “It will just about ruin Mr. Wadsworth,
Uncle Dunston says.”
</p>
<p>
“Let us hope for the best, Laura.”
</p>
<p>
“I heard you and the other boys talking about
Nick Jasniff and Link Merwell.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes?”
</p>
<p>
“Do you really imagine they had something
to do with it?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I think so, and so do Phil, Ben, and
Roger. But the detectives and Mr. Wadsworth
think the work was done by professionals. They
don’t think that fellows like Nick and Link would
be equal to the job.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121'></a>121</span>
</p>
<p>
“But if you think Merwell and Jasniff guilty,
why don’t you go after them and find out?”
</p>
<p>
“We don’t know where they are.”
</p>
<p>
“Aren’t they with their folks?”
</p>
<p>
“No.”
</p>
<p>
“Are you sure?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes. The Jasniffs are traveling aboard and
Mr. Merwell is in Philadelphia. We sent to Mr.
Merwell—through an outsider—and learned that
he didn’t know where Link was just now, said he
had written that he was going on a tour south for
the winter. My private opinion is that Mr. Merwell
finds Link hard to manage and is glad to get
rid of him.”
</p>
<p>
“Do you suppose he did go south?”
</p>
<p>
“He might—after this affair here.”
</p>
<p>
“They didn’t say what part of the south he
went to?”
</p>
<p>
“They said Florida. But Florida is pretty big,
you know,” and Dave smiled faintly.
</p>
<p>
“Jessie is awfully downcast over this, and so
is Mrs. Wadsworth—in fact, we all are.”
</p>
<p>
“I know it, Laura.” Dave drew a long breath.
“It’s awfully hard to sit still and do nothing.
I imagine Mr. Wadsworth can’t sleep for thinking
of the affair.”
</p>
<p>
“I heard Mrs. Wadsworth talking last night
to him. I didn’t mean to listen, Dave, but before
I could get away I heard her say that if it was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122'></a>122</span>
necessary she would give up this house to live in
and move to a smaller place! Think of it! Why,
her very heart is set on this house and these fine
grounds! And Jessie thinks the world of them,
too!”
</p>
<p>
“It would be awfully hard if they did have to
give them up, Laura.”
</p>
<p>
“Dave, can’t father or Uncle Dunston help
them, if they need help?”
</p>
<p>
“They have helped Mr. Wadsworth already—loaned
him twenty thousand dollars so that he
could put that new addition to the works. They
also indorsed his note covering the safe return of
the jewels. If those jewels aren’t gotten back,
and Mr. Wadsworth can’t make good on that note,
father and Uncle Dunston will have to pay the
money.”
</p>
<p>
“All of it?”
</p>
<p>
“As much as Mr. Wadsworth can’t pay. And
the worst of the whole matter is, Laura, just at
present father and Uncle Dunston have their
ready money tied up in such a manner that they
can’t get hold of it excepting at a great loss. Oh,
it certainly is a terrible state of affairs!” And
Dave shook his head, gravely.
</p>
<p>
During that week Ben had Shadow Hamilton
and Buster Beggs visit him. Of course, the
new arrivals had to hear all about the robbery,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123'></a>123</span>
and they came over with Ben to call on the other
boys, and on the girls.
</p>
<p>
“This is fierce!” was Buster’s comment.
“And Ben says you rather suspect Merwell and
Jasniff,” he added, in a whisper.
</p>
<p>
“We do, but don’t say anything to any outsiders
about it,” answered Dave.
</p>
<p>
“Say, that puts me in mind of a story,” said
Shadow. “A little girl once——”
</p>
<p>
“Wow! Cut it out, Shadow!” burst out
Phil.
</p>
<p>
“Stories don’t go with robberies,” supplemented
Roger.
</p>
<p>
“Let him tell it,” put in Dave, with a faint
smile. “It will relieve his mind, and I guess I
need a little fun to brace me up—I’ve been so
depressed lately.”
</p>
<p>
“This isn’t so very much of a story,” went on
Shadow, as all looked at him. “Dave telling
Buster not to let outsiders know put me in mind
of it. Once the mother of a little girl told her
that her uncle had been naughty and had been
put in prison for it. Said the mother, ‘Now,
Lucy, don’t tell anybody.’ So Lucy went out to
play and pretty soon, when she had all her companions
around her she said, ‘What do you think
my ma said? She said that when anybody has an
uncle in prison, like my uncle is, you mustn’t tell
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124'></a>124</span>
anybody. So I’m not going to tell a single person!’”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I guess the boys know what I mean,”
said Dave, after a short laugh. “I want you to
keep this to yourselves. Don’t spread it any
further. It may be that I am mistaken, and if so,
and Merwell and Jasniff heard of what I have
said, they would come down on me like a ton of
bricks—and I’d not blame them.”
</p>
<p>
In the afternoon, urged by Mrs. Wadsworth,
the boys went skating, taking the girls with them.
On the ice they met Nat Poole, but the money-lender’s
son did not speak to them, indeed he did
his best to keep out of their way.
</p>
<p>
“He hasn’t forgotten New Year’s Eve,” said
Ben. “He had better keep his distance, unless
he wants to get into more trouble.”
</p>
<p>
“Wonder what he thinks of the robbery?”
mused Dave.
</p>
<p>
“We might get Buster to pump him,” suggested
Phil. “He is on pretty good terms with
Nat,—that is, they are not open enemies.”
</p>
<p>
Buster was appealed to and he readily agreed to
do the “pumping,” provided the money-lender’s
son had anything to say. He skated off by himself
and then threw himself in Nat’s way, and was
gone the best part of half an hour.
</p>
<p>
“Well, did you learn anything?” queried
Roger, when the stout youth returned.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125'></a>125</span>
</p>
<p>
“I guess I did!” cried Buster. “Say, I think
Nat Poole is about as mean as they make ’em!”
he burst out. “And he hasn’t a grain of good,
hard common-sense!”
</p>
<p>
“What did he say?” demanded Phil.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, he said a lot of things, about the robbery,
and about the Wadsworths and the Porters.
First he said he didn’t believe the jewels were
nearly as valuable as Mr. Wadsworth represented
them to be, and the manufacturer was kicking up
a big fuss just as a sort of advertisement. Then
he said there was a report that Dave had been
seen in front of the works just a few minutes
before the explosion, and that that looked mighty
suspicious to him.”
</p>
<p>
“The mean fellow!” muttered Roger.
</p>
<p>
“I told him that you and Roger were going
to the Wadsworth house at the time, and were
home when the watchman telephoned, but he only
tossed his head as if he didn’t believe a word of
it, and said he guessed Dave could tell something
if he was of a mind to talk.”
</p>
<p>
“If that isn’t Poole to a T!” cried Phil.
</p>
<p>
“If I were you, Dave, I’d punch his head for
him,” was Shadow’s advice.
</p>
<p>
“That wouldn’t do any good,” said Ben.
“You can’t stop Nat from talking any more than
you can stop water from running out of a
sieve.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126'></a>126</span>
</p>
<p>
“Which puts me in mind of another story,”
burst out Shadow, eagerly. “Once two men——”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Shadow, another?” cried Buster, reproachfully.
</p>
<p>
“I know that story—it’s moss-covered with
age,” announced Roger.
</p>
<p>
“What is it?” demanded the story-teller of
Oak Hall.
</p>
<p>
“Two men—bet—carry water in a sieve—bet
taken—water frozen. Ha! ha! Shadow, I got you
that time.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, it’s a good story anyway,” answered
Shadow, ruefully.
</p>
<p>
“I shan’t attempt to stop Nat unless he makes
some direct accusation,” said Dave, calmly.
“What would be the use? It would only make
matters worse.”
</p>
<p>
“If you took notice of what he says, some folks
would begin to think there was something in it,”
said Phil. “Yes, better drop Nat. He isn’t
worth bothering about, anyway. Just the same,
it is mean for him to speak in this fashion.”
</p>
<p>
“He wouldn’t be Nat Poole if he didn’t,” retorted
Roger.
</p>
<p>
Despite this incident, the boys and girls managed
to have a good time on the ice, and for an
hour or two Dave forgot his troubles and those of
his friends.
</p>
<p>
“What are you going to do for the rest of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127'></a>127</span>
vacation, Dave?” said Roger, that evening.
“You know you promised to come to my home.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, and you promised to visit me, too,” added
Phil. “You haven’t been to our house in a long
time.”
</p>
<p>
“To tell the truth, I haven’t the heart to go
anywhere,” answered Dave, soberly. “I guess I
had better stay here and see if something doesn’t
turn up.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I can’t blame you,” said the senator’s
son, and Phil said the same.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128'></a>128</span><a name='chXIV' id='chXIV'></a>CHAPTER XIV—OFF FOR THE SOUTH</h2>
<p>
Two days later, when Roger was packing up,
getting ready to return home, he received a letter
from Luke Watson that filled him with interest.
Luke had gone to St. Augustine, Florida, to join
his folks, who were spending the winter there.
</p>
<p>
“Here’s news!” burst out the senator’s son, as
he came rushing to Dave and Phil with the epistle.
“This letter is from Luke Watson, you know his
folks are in Florida. Well, on his way to St.
Augustine, Luke stopped for a day at Jacksonville.
Listen to what he says:
</p>
<p>
“‘I was walking down one of the main streets
of Jacksonville, looking into the shop windows,
when what do you think? I saw Link Merwell
and Nick Jasniff. You could have knocked me
over with a feather, for I hadn’t imagined that
they were anywhere near. They were nattily
dressed and each carried a small valise, and they
were buying caps and some other things for a sea
voyage. I went into the shop and called to them,
and my! both of them jumped as if they were shot,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129'></a>129</span>
and Merwell got so pale I thought he was going
to faint. I said “Hello,” but they didn’t answer
to that, and Jasniff at once wanted to know if I
was alone. When I told him I was he seemed
mightily relieved, and Merwell looked relieved,
too. They wanted to know what I was doing
there and I told them. Then I asked what they
were doing, but I couldn’t get any straight answer.
Merwell started to say something about going to
sea, but Jasniff stopped him short, and said they
guessed they would go back to New York, where
they had come from.
</p>
<p>
“‘It was awful funny—they positively looked
scared to death, and while they were talking to
me they looked over my shoulders, as if on their
guard against somebody. I asked them what
they had been doing since they left Rockville, and
they said not much of anything, just traveling
around. They seemed to have plenty of money,
for just as I went into the shop I saw Merwell pay
for something from a big roll of greenbacks.
</p>
<p>
“‘After I left them, I got a bit curious about
the pair, and so I watched them come from the
shop and walk down to one of the docks and go
aboard a big four-masted schooner. I hung
around a little and pretty soon they came from the
schooner and went up to one of the big hotels, and
there I lost sight of them. Each had his little
valise with him, but they weren’t big enough for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130'></a>130</span>
much clothing. My, but they were scared! I
fancy they thought I might pitch into them for
the mean things they did in the past. But I didn’t
want to start any row.’”
</p>
<p>
“Is that all he says?” demanded Dave, after
the senator’s son had finished.
</p>
<p>
“That’s all he says about Merwell and Jasniff
and their doings.”
</p>
<p>
“Doesn’t he mention the name of that schooner,
or the hotel?” asked Phil.
</p>
<p>
“No.”
</p>
<p>
“Did you say Luke was going to Jacksonville?”
asked our hero.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, his whole family are down there.”
</p>
<p>
“Then I could telegraph to him and he could
give me the name of the hotel, and of the
schooner.”
</p>
<p>
“Dave, what do you make out of this?” demanded
the senator’s son.
</p>
<p>
“I make out of it that Merwell and Jasniff
are guilty!” burst out Dave. “They went from
here to Florida, and now they have either gone to
sea, or are going, as soon as that schooner sails.
Do you notice what Luke says about their being
scared almost to death when they saw him? They
evidently thought some of us, or the officers of the
law, were with him.”
</p>
<p>
“And the little valises!” burst out the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131'></a>131</span>
shipowner’s son. “Perhaps they contain the
jewels!”
</p>
<p>
“Would they be foolish enough to carry them
around like that?” questioned Roger. “Wouldn’t
they hide them?”
</p>
<p>
“They may be looking for some good hiding-place,
or some place where they can sell them,”
answered Dave. “Remember, Jasniff and Merwell
are green at this business—they wouldn’t go
at it like professionals. If they were professionals,
they wouldn’t have acted so scared.”
</p>
<p>
“That is true. What will you do, tell Mr.
Wadsworth of this?”
</p>
<p>
“I think I’ll tell my father and my Uncle
Dunston first. Mr. Wadsworth doesn’t place
much credit in the story of Merwell and Jasniff’s
guilt. He thinks the detectives are on the right
track.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, possibly they are,” admitted Phil.
“But I must say, this looks mighty suspicious to
me.”
</p>
<p>
“I have half a mind to take matters in my own
hands and run down to Jacksonville,” went on
our hero. “Who knows but what I might find
Merwell and Jasniff? If I did, I could stop
them and make them give an account of themselves
by making that old charge of abduction
against them, and that charge of having used
my name.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132'></a>132</span>
</p>
<p>
“Say, that’s an idea!” cried Roger. “And
say, I’d like to go with you.”
</p>
<p>
“So would I,” added Phil. “We might go
down in one of my father’s ships.”
</p>
<p>
“Too slow, Phil—the limited express for this
trip,” answered Dave. “But I must talk it over
with dad first,” he added.
</p>
<p>
“We have got over three weeks before school
opens again,” pursued the senator’s son. “We
could go down to Florida and back easily in that
time.”
</p>
<p>
Dave’s father had gone to New York on business,
but came home that evening. In the meantime
a telegram was sent to Luke Watson, asking
for the name of the hotel, at which Merwell
and Jasniff had stopped, and of the schooner.
</p>
<p>
Dave’s father and his uncle listened closely to
what he had to tell, and to the reading of the letter
from Luke Watson. They talked the affair
over for an hour with the boys.
</p>
<p>
“You may be right, boys,” said Mr. Porter,
at last. “And it may be a good plan to follow
those rascals up. But I don’t think I would bother
Mr. Wadsworth about it. He received a telegram
from one of the detectives, and the officer
is more sure than ever that he is on the right
track. He caught Red Andrews pawning a fair-sized
diamond, and he thinks the gem is from the
Carwith collection.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133'></a>133</span>
</p>
<p>
“Can’t he make Red Andrews confess?” asked
Dave.
</p>
<p>
“Unfortunately the rascal got away when on the
way to the police-station. But the detective feels
he can soon round him up again.”
</p>
<p>
Dave looked thoughtfully out of the window
and tapped the table with his fingers.
</p>
<p>
“You still think Merwell and Jasniff guilty?”
remarked his uncle, with a smile.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, Uncle Dunston. After what Hooker
Montgomery said, I’ll think them guilty until
somebody proves otherwise.”
</p>
<p>
“Then I tell you what I’ll do, boys,” said
Dunston Porter. “I’ll take a trip down to Florida
with you and look into this matter. I’d rather be
on the move than sitting still waiting for something
to turn up.”
</p>
<p>
“Will you go?” cried Dave, eagerly.
</p>
<p>
“I will.”
</p>
<p>
“When?”
</p>
<p>
“As soon as you wish, and we can get train
accommodations.”
</p>
<p>
“Hadn’t we better wait until we hear from
Luke?” suggested Roger.
</p>
<p>
“No, let us get off at once!” exclaimed Dave.
“If he sends word after we are gone, it can be
forwarded to us.” And so it was arranged.
</p>
<p>
Great was the surprise of the Wadsworths and
of Laura when the boys and Dunston Porter announced
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134'></a>134</span>
that they were going to start for Florida
the next morning.
</p>
<p>
“Why, Dave?” asked Jessie. “Why are you
going in such a hurry?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I hardly care to tell, Jessie,” he answered.
“It may prove only a wild goose chase.”
</p>
<p>
“It is about the missing jewels?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes.”
</p>
<p>
“Then you are after Merwell and Jasniff.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, but please don’t tell any outsiders.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Dave, don’t get into any trouble!” cried
the girl, as she clung to him. “They are such bad
fellows! You know what they have done to you in
the past!”
</p>
<p>
“I am not afraid of them.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I know how brave you are, Dave! But—but
don’t let them harm you—for my sake,
please!” And then the tears came into her eyes
and she hid her face on his arm.
</p>
<p>
“There! there! don’t worry!” he said, as he
bent over her, and then he kissed her forehead.
“We’ll be back before long,” and he gave her a
little hug. Then the others came in.
</p>
<p>
Laura was also worried, but glad that her uncle
would be along. She helped Dave to pack his
suit-case. Phil and Roger also packed up, and
sent word home regarding the proposed trip. As
my old readers know, all the boys were well-to-do,
so the expenses did not bother them.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135'></a>135</span>
</p>
<p>
At breakfast time the following morning came
a telegram from Luke Watson. It read as follows:
</p>
<p>
“The hotel was the Castor. Think schooner
was the <em>Emma Brown</em>, or <em>Black</em>, or <em>Jones</em>. Common
name.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, that isn’t very definite, but it is something
to work on,” remarked Dunston Porter.
</p>
<p>
Soon the party of four were ready to start.
There was a general hand-shaking and also a few
kisses.
</p>
<p>
“Well, have a good time, even if you don’t
catch those fellows,” said Mrs. Wadsworth.
</p>
<p>
“Keep out of trouble,” warned Laura.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, yes, don’t let them harm you,” pleaded
timid Jessie.
</p>
<p>
“And let us hear from you often,” said Mr.
Porter.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know what to say about this,” said
Oliver Wadsworth, shaking his head, slowly.
“But if you do get on the track of those jewels,
leave no stone unturned to get them.”
</p>
<p>
“Leave that to me, Mr. Wadsworth,” said
Dunston Porter. “If we find those young men
have the gems—or had them—we’ll get them
back, never fear.” And he spoke in a tone that
showed he meant what he said.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136'></a>136</span>
</p>
<p>
They went to the depot in the family sleigh.
Ben had heard of their going away and was there
to see them off. Soon the train rolled in that was
to carry the travelers to New York City.
</p>
<p>
“Good-by!” cried the boys, as they clambered
aboard the car.
</p>
<p>
“Good-by!” called Ben. “I wish you luck.”
And then the girls waved their hands, and the
train moved off, slowly at first and then faster
and faster, until Crumville was left behind.
</p>
<p>
“It’s a great trip they are taking,” said Ben,
to Laura and Jessie. “Wish I was going along.”
</p>
<p>
“Why didn’t you go?” questioned Laura.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I’ve got some things to do at home,”
answered Ben. He did not care to add that his
father did not wish to stand the extra expense.
Mr. Basswood was fairly well-to-do, but thought
he was spending enough on his son by sending him
to boarding-school.
</p>
<p>
The sleigh was about to drive off when the
station agent came running out, waving a yellow
envelope.
</p>
<p>
“Is Mr. Wadsworth here?” he questioned, of
Jessie.
</p>
<p>
“No, Mr. Mack, my father went to business.
What is it, a telegram?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,—something very important too.”
</p>
<p>
“Then give it to me and I will take it to him
at once.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137'></a>137</span>
</p>
<p>
“I could send it, but——”
</p>
<p>
“Never mind. Here, I will sign for it,” and
Jessie did so. Then the whip cracked and the
horses started for the jewelry works on a gallop.
</p>
<p>
When Jessie handed the telegram to her father
he opened it and read the contents eagerly. His
face lit up.
</p>
<p>
“This is good news!” he cried. “Good news!
I must go to Boston at once.”
</p>
<p>
“Have they found the jewels?” questioned his
daughter.
</p>
<p>
“The detective thinks he has located them.
Yes, I must go at once.” And Mr. Wadsworth
hurried off to prepare for the journey.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138'></a>138</span><a name='chXV' id='chXV'></a>CHAPTER XV—SOMETHING ABOUT WHITE MICE</h2>
<p>
Dunston Porter and the boys were to go to
New York City and there transfer to Jersey City
for the train bound South. All had comfortable
seats together.
</p>
<p>
“It’s going to be quite a trip,” said Roger, as
he settled back to gaze at the swiftly-moving panorama
of fields covered with snow.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, and we are going to journey from winter
into summer,” added Phil. “It’s good we remembered
that when we packed our suit-cases. At
first I was going to put in nothing but heavy clothing.”
</p>
<p>
“I am glad we heard from Luke,” said Dave.
“That gives us a little to work on. I hope the
<em>Emma Brown</em>, or whatever her name may be,
hasn’t sailed yet.”
</p>
<p>
“Won’t Merwell and Jasniff be surprised if
we do locate them?” said the senator’s son. “I
suppose they think we are at home.”
</p>
<p>
The car was only half-filled with passengers,
so the boys and Dunston Porter had plenty of
room, and they moved around from one seat to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139'></a>139</span>
another. So the time passed quickly enough, until
they rolled into the Grand Central Station, in
New York.
</p>
<p>
“Well, little old New York looks as busy as
ever,” was Phil’s comment, as they stepped out
on the street. “Are we to transfer to Jersey City
at once?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” answered Dunston Porter. “We’ll take
the subway and the river tube, and get there in
no time.”
</p>
<p>
Riding through the tube under the Hudson
River was a new experience for the lads and they
rather enjoyed it. The train of steel cars rushed
along at a good rate of speed, and almost before
they knew it, they were in New Jersey and being
hoisted up in an elevator to the train-shed.
</p>
<p>
“Coast Line Express!” was the cry at one of
the numerous gates to the tracks, and thither the
party hurried. Willing porters took their baggage,
and a minute later they found themselves in
an elegant Pullman car. Dunston Porter had telegraphed
ahead for sleeping accommodations, and
they had two double seats opposite each other,
directly in the middle of the car.
</p>
<p>
“All aboard!” sang out the conductor, about
ten minutes later, and then the long train rolled
slowly from the big train-shed, and the trip to
Florida could be said to have fairly begun.
</p>
<p>
“Do we go by the way of Philadelphia and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140'></a>140</span>
Washington?” asked Phil, who had not taken
the time to study the route.
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” answered Dunston Porter. “Here is
a time-table. That will show you the whole route
and tell you just when we get to each place.”
</p>
<p>
“Will we have to make any changes?” asked
Roger.
</p>
<p>
“None whatever.”
</p>
<p>
Soon the train had left Jersey City behind and
a little later it stopped at Newark, and then sped
on towards Philadelphia. By this time it had
grown too dark to see the landscape and the boys
and Dunston Porter retired.
</p>
<p>
On and on through the long night rolled the
train, keeping fairly close to the Atlantic sea-coast.
With nothing to do, the boys did not arise until
late in the morning. They found Dave’s uncle in
the lavatory ahead of them, indulging in the luxury
of a shave with a safety razor.
</p>
<p>
“Well, how are you feeling?” asked Dunston
Porter.
</p>
<p>
“Fine!” cried Dave.
</p>
<p>
“Couldn’t feel better,” added the senator’s
son.
</p>
<p>
“Ready for a big breakfast?”
</p>
<p>
“I am,” answered Phil, promptly. “Gracious,
but traveling makes me hungry!”
</p>
<p>
They had to wait a little before they could get
seats together in the dining-car and they amused
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141'></a>141</span>
themselves by gazing at the settlements through
which they were passing. Here and there were
numerous cabins, with hordes of colored children
playing about.
</p>
<p>
“This is the Southland, true enough,” observed
Dave. “Just see how happy those pickaninnies
seem to be!”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, one would almost envy their care-free
dispositions,” answered Dunston Porter. “Their
manner shows that it doesn’t take money to make
one happy.”
</p>
<p>
They had passed through Richmond and were
now on their way to Emporia. It was growing
steadily warmer, and by noon all were glad
enough to leave the car and go out on the observation
platform at the end of the train.
</p>
<p>
The next stop was at Fayetteville and after that
came Charleston. Long before this the snow had
disappeared and the fields looked as green as in
the fall at home.
</p>
<p>
“We’ll be at Jacksonville when you wake up
in the morning,” said Dunston Porter, as they
turned into their berths the second night on the
train.
</p>
<p>
“Good! We can’t get there any too quick for
me!” answered Dave.
</p>
<p>
“You mustn’t expect too much, Dave. You
may be bitterly disappointed,” remarked his uncle,
gravely.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142'></a>142</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh, we’ve just got to catch Merwell and
Jasniff, Uncle Dunston!”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, but they may not be guilty. You’ll have
to go slow about accusing them.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I want to catch them and question them
anyway. I can have them detained on the old
charge, you know—that is, if they try to get
away from me.”
</p>
<p>
Dave and Phil slept on one side of the car, with
Dunston Porter and Roger on the other. As the
steam heat was still turned on, it was uncomfortably
warm, and as a consequence Dave was rather
restless. He tumbled and tossed in his berth,
which was the upper one, and wished that the night
were over and that they were in Jacksonville.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, pshaw! I really must get some sleep!”
he told himself. “If I don’t, I’ll be as sleepy as
an owl to-morrow and not fit to hunt up those
rascals. Yes, I must go to sleep,” and he did what
he could to settle himself.
</p>
<p>
He had just closed his eyes when a peculiar
noise below him made him start up. Phil was
thrashing around wildly.
</p>
<p>
“What’s the matter, Phil?” he asked, in a
low tone.
</p>
<p>
“Something is in my berth, some animal, or
something!” answered the shipowner’s son. “I
can’t go to sleep for it. Every time I lie down
it begins to move.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143'></a>143</span>
</p>
<p>
“Maybe it’s a rat.”
</p>
<p>
“Whoever heard of a rat in a sleeping-car?”
snorted Phil.
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps you were dreaming. I didn’t hear
anything,” went on Dave.
</p>
<p>
“No, I wasn’t dreaming—I heard it as plain
as day.”
</p>
<p>
“Better go to bed and forget it, Phil,” and
then Dave lay down again. The shipowner’s
son grumbled a little under his breath, then turned
off his electric light, and sank on his pillow once
more.
</p>
<p>
Dave remained quiet for several minutes and
then sat bolt upright and gave a low cry. There
was no mistake about it, something had moved
over his feet and given him a slight nip in the
toe.
</p>
<p>
“Phil!” he called, softly. “Did you do that?
Come, no fooling now. This is no place for
jokes.”
</p>
<p>
“Do what?”
</p>
<p>
“Pinch me in the toe.”
</p>
<p>
“I haven’t touched your toe. How can I from
the lower berth?”
</p>
<p>
“Well, something nipped me.”
</p>
<p>
“Maybe it’s you who are dreaming this trip,
Dave,” returned the shipowner’s son, with pardonable
sarcasm.
</p>
<p>
Dave did not reply, for just then he felt something
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144'></a>144</span>
moving in the blanket. He made a clutch
for it. A little squeak followed.
</p>
<p>
“I’ve got it, Phil!”
</p>
<p>
“What is it?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know yet—it’s in the blanket.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, what a noise!” came from the berth beyond.
“Cannot you young men be quiet?” It
was a woman who was speaking. She was an
elderly person and Dave had noticed, during the
day, that she was rather sour-looking.
</p>
<p>
“Sorry, madam, but I’ve just caught something
in my berth,” answered Dave. “I’ll turn
up the light and see what it is,” he added, as he
held on to the object in the blanket with one hand
and turned on the electric illumination with the
other.
</p>
<p>
The cries and talking had awakened half a
dozen people and the sleepy porter came down
the aisle to find out what was wrong.
</p>
<p>
“It’s a mouse—a white mouse!” cried Dave, as
the little creature was uncovered.
</p>
<p>
“Wot’s dat, a mouse!” exclaimed the porter.
“Nebber heard of sech a t’ing! How did he git
yeah?”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t ask me,” replied Dave. “Ugh! he
nipped me in the toe, too!”
</p>
<p>
“Here’s another one!” roared Phil. “Ran
right across my arm! Take that, you little imp!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145'></a>145</span>
he added, and bang! one of his shoes hit the woodwork
of the car.
</p>
<p>
“A mouse!” shrieked the elderly woman.
“Did you say a mouse, young man?”
</p>
<p>
“I did—and there is more than one, too,” answered
Dave, for he had felt another movement
at his feet. He lost no time in scrambling up,
and Phil followed.
</p>
<p>
By this time the whole sleeping-car was in an
uproar. Everybody who heard the word “mouse”
felt certain one of the creatures must be in his
or her berth.
</p>
<p>
“Porter! porter! save me!” screamed the
elderly lady. “Oh, mice, just think of it!” And
wrapping her dressing-gown around her, she leaped
from her berth and sped for the ladies’ room.
Others also got up, including Dunston Porter and
Roger.
</p>
<p>
“What am I going to do with this fellow?”
asked Dave, as he held the mouse up in his vest.
</p>
<p>
“Better throw it out of a window,” suggested
his uncle. “Mice in a sleeper! This is certainly
the limit!” he muttered. “The railroad company
better get a new system of cleaning.”
</p>
<p>
“Mice!” screamed a young lady. “Oh, I
shall die!” she shrieked, and looked ready to
faint.
</p>
<p>
“Shoot ’em, why don’t you?” suggested a fat
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146'></a>146</span>
man, who came forth from his berth wearing a
blanket, Indian fashion.
</p>
<p>
By this time Phil had caught one of the creatures.
Both he and Dave started for the rear of
the car, to throw the mice off the train.
</p>
<p>
“Stop! stop! I beg of you, don’t kill those
mice!” came suddenly from a tall, thin young man
who had been sleeping in a berth at the end of
the car. Dave had noticed him during the day and
had put him down as a preacher or actor.
</p>
<p>
“Why not?” asked our hero.
</p>
<p>
“They are mine, that’s why,” said the man.
“I would not have them killed for a thousand dollars!”
</p>
<p>
“Say, wot yo’-all talkin’ about?” demanded
the porter. “Dem mice yours?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes! yes! Oh, please do not kill them!”
pleaded the tall, thin man. “They won’t hurt
anybody, really they won’t.”
</p>
<p>
“Say, are them white mice educated?” demanded
the fat man.
</p>
<p>
“Indeed they are—I educated them myself,”
answered the other man. “I spent months in
doing it, too. They are the best-educated white
mice in the United States,” he added, proudly.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147'></a>147</span><a name='chXVI' id='chXVI'></a>CHAPTER XVI—PICKING UP THE TRAIL</h2>
<p>
The announcement that the mice that had been
caught in the car were educated filled the boys
with interest, but it did not lessen their indignation
nor that of the other passengers.
</p>
<p>
“The idea of mice on the train, even if they
are educated!” shrilled the elderly lady.
</p>
<p>
“It’s outrageous!” stormed another lady. “I
never heard of such a thing in all my life!”
</p>
<p>
“Say, you must take this for a cattle train!”
remarked the fat man, bluntly. “If you do, you’ve
got another guess coming.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, my dear, sweet mice,” said the tall, slim
man, as he took the animal from Dave and also
the one that Phil was holding. “That is King
Hal and this one is President Tom! They are
both highly educated. They can——”
</p>
<p>
“Say, howsoeber did yo’-all git dem trash in
dis cah!” demanded the porter.
</p>
<p>
“I—er—I had them in a cage in my—er—in
my suit-case,” the owner of the mice answered, and
now his voice faltered. “I really didn’t think
they would get out.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148'></a>148</span>
</p>
<p>
“We don’t allow no mice in de sleepin’-cahs!”
stormed the porter. “Dogs, an’ cats, an’ parrots,
an’ mice goes in de baggage-cah.”
</p>
<p>
“Are there any more of them loose?” asked
one of the ladies.
</p>
<p>
“I will see!” cried the tall, slim man. “I
forgot about that! Oh, I hope they are safe!
If they are not, what shall I do? I have an engagement
in Jacksonville, and another in St.
Augustine, to fill.”
</p>
<p>
“Do you show ’em on the stage?” snorted the
fat man.
</p>
<p>
“To be sure. Haven’t you heard of me, Professor
Richard De Haven, the world-famous
trainer of mice, rats, and cats? I have exhibited
my mice in all the countries of the world, and——”
</p>
<p>
“Never mind that just now,” interrupted Dunston
Porter. “Go and see if the others are safe,
otherwise we’ll have to round up your live-stock
before we go to sleep again.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I shall never sleep another wink in this
car!” sighed a lady.
</p>
<p>
“I shall!” snorted the fat man, “or else get the
price of my berth out of that chap, or the railroad
company!”
</p>
<p>
Professor De Haven ran to his berth and
dragged forth a dress-suit-case. A moment later
he uttered a genuine howl of dismay.
</p>
<p>
“They are all gone!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149'></a>149</span>
</p>
<p>
“How many?” queried Dave, who had followed
him.
</p>
<p>
“Sixteen of them, not counting the two I have
here now! O dear, what shall I do?” And the
professor wrung his hands in despair.
</p>
<p>
“Sixteen mice at large!” shrieked one of the
ladies. “Oh, stop the train! I want to get off!”
</p>
<p>
“Can’t stop no train now,” answered the porter.
“We’se got to jest catch dem mice somehow,
but I dunno how it’s gwine to be done,” he
went on, scratching his woolly head in perplexity.
</p>
<p>
“I’ve got a shotgun along,” suggested the fat
man. “Might go gunning with that.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll get my cane,” said another man.
</p>
<p>
“I guess the ladies better retire to the next
car,” suggested a third passenger.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, yes, let us go, at once!” cried the elderly
lady. “Porter, can I get a berth there?”
</p>
<p>
“Sorry, missus, but I dun reckon all de berths
on dis yeah train am tooken.”
</p>
<p>
“See here!” cried Dave, to Professor De
Haven. “If the mice are educated, can’t you call
them to you in some way?”
</p>
<p>
“To be sure!” cried the professor, struck by the
idea. “Why did I not think of that myself? I
was too upset to think of anything. Yes, I can
whistle for them.”
</p>
<p>
“Whistle for ’em?” snorted the fat man.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, yes! I always whistle when I feed them.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150'></a>150</span>
Please be quiet. I shall have to whistle loudly,
for the train makes such a noise and it may be
some of my dear pets may not hear me!”
</p>
<p>
“Humph! Then you better whistle for all
you’re worth!” returned the man of weight.
</p>
<p>
Walking slowly up and down the sleeping-car
Professor De Haven commenced to whistle in a
clear, steady trill. He kept this up for fully a
minute and by that time several white mice had
shown themselves. They were somewhat scared,
but gradually they came to him and ran up on his
shoulders.
</p>
<p>
“Well, doesn’t that beat the Dutch!” whispered
Roger, half in admiration.
</p>
<p>
“I shouldn’t have been so scared if I had known
they were educated,” returned Phil.
</p>
<p>
“Hush!” said Dave. “Give him a chance to
gather them all in.”
</p>
<p>
Placing the captured mice in their cage, the professor
moved up and down the car once more,
opening the berth curtains as he did so. He continued
to emit that same clear trill, and soon his
shoulders were full of the white mice.
</p>
<p>
“Only one is missing, little General Pinky,” he
announced.
</p>
<p>
“Spit, spat, spow! Where did Pinky go?”
murmured Phil.
</p>
<p>
“Ha! I have him! Dear little Pinky!” cried
the professor, as the mouse dropped onto his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151'></a>151</span>
shoulder from an upper berth. “Now I have
them all, ladies and gentlemen,” he announced.
“You can go to sleep without alarm. I shall take
good care that they do not get away again.”
</p>
<p>
“I dun reckon I’se gwine to take care of dat!”
put in the porter. “Dem mice am gwine into de
baggage-cah dis minit!”
</p>
<p>
“But, my dear fellow——” broke in the professor.
</p>
<p>
“I ain’t a-gwine to argy de question, mistah.
Da is gwine in de baggage-cah!” And the porter
reached out and caught hold of the cage containing
the mice.
</p>
<p>
“Then I shall go with them,” answered the
professor, resignedly.
</p>
<p>
“Suit yo’ self, sah.”
</p>
<p>
“But they wouldn’t hurt a flea!”
</p>
<p>
“Can’t help it, sah, it’s de baggage-cah fo’ dis
collection of wild animals,” answered the porter,
striding off with the cage in his hands, while the
professor followed.
</p>
<p>
“Talk about something happening!” burst out
Roger, when the excitement was over. “This was
the funniest experience I ever had.”
</p>
<p>
“I am sure I don’t see anything funny about
it!” snapped the elderly lady, who overheard the
remark. “I think that man ought to be prosecuted!”
</p>
<p>
“He didn’t expect his mice to get loose,” said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152'></a>152</span>
Dunston Porter. “Just the same, he had no right
to bring them in here. As the porter said, all
animals must go in the baggage-car.”
</p>
<p>
“Wonder if he’ll come back,” mused Phil.
</p>
<p>
“I doubt it,” answered Dave. “Well, now I’m
going to try to get a little sleep,” he added, as he
climbed back into his berth. The others followed
suit, and presently one after another dropped into
slumber. It may be added here that Professor
De Haven did not show himself again while on
the train, he being afraid of the indignation of
those who had been disturbed by his educated
mice.
</p>
<p>
Early the following morning found our friends
in the city of Jacksonville, which, as my readers
must know, is located on the St. John’s River.
They did not wait for breakfast but hurried at
once in the direction of the Hotel Castor, once a
leading hostelry of the city, but which had seen
its best day.
</p>
<p>
“Quite a town,” remarked the senator’s son,
as they passed along.
</p>
<p>
“Jacksonville is now the main city of Florida,”
replied Dunston Porter. “It is a great shipping
center, and is also well-known as a winter
resort.”
</p>
<p>
“How balmy the weather is!” was Phil’s comment.
“Just like spring at home!”
</p>
<p>
Dave’s uncle had been in Jacksonville several
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153'></a>153</span>
times and knew the way well. Soon they reached
the hotel, and with his heart beating loudly, Dave
hurried up to the desk and asked the clerk if Link
Merwell and Nick Jasniff were stopping there.
</p>
<p>
“Never heard of them,” replied the clerk, after
thinking a moment.
</p>
<p>
“I have photographs, perhaps you can tell
them from that,” went on Dave, and he drew from
his pocket two photographs, taken at different
times at Oak Hall. Each showed a group of
students, and in one group was Merwell and in
the other Jasniff.
</p>
<p>
The clerk looked at the pictures closely.
</p>
<p>
“What is this, some joke?” he asked, suspiciously.
</p>
<p>
“No, it is a matter of great importance,” answered
Dave. “We must find those two young
men if we possibly can.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, if they are the pair who were here some
days ago, you are too late. But their names
weren’t what you said.”
</p>
<p>
“What did they call themselves?” asked Dunston
Porter.
</p>
<p>
“John Leeds and Samuel Cross,” answered the
clerk. “They had Room 87, and were here two
days.”
</p>
<p>
“Do you know where they went to?” asked
Phil.
</p>
<p>
“I do not.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154'></a>154</span>
</p>
<p>
“Can you tell me anything at all about them?”
went on Dave. “It is very important, indeed.”
</p>
<p>
“I might as well tell you,” put in Mr. Porter,
in a low voice. “They were a pair of criminals.”
</p>
<p>
“You don’t say! Well, do you know, I didn’t
much like their looks,” returned the clerk. “And
come to think of it, one acted rather scared-like,
the fellow calling himself Leeds—this one,” and
he pointed to the picture of Link Merwell.
</p>
<p>
“And you haven’t any idea where they went
to?”
</p>
<p>
“Not the slightest. They simply paid their
bill and went away.”
</p>
<p>
“Did they have any trunks sent off?” asked
Roger. “We might find the expressman,” he
explained, to the others.
</p>
<p>
“No, they had nothing but hand baggage.”
</p>
<p>
“What—can you remember that?” questioned
Dave.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, each had a suit-case and a small valise,—kind
of a tool-bag affair.”
</p>
<p>
“Better look for that schooner, Dave,” said
his uncle, in a low voice, and in a few minutes
more they left the hotel, telling the clerk that
they might be back.
</p>
<p>
“Shall we get breakfast now?” questioned the
senator’s son. He was beginning to grow hungry.
</p>
<p>
“You can get something to eat if you wish,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155'></a>155</span>
Roger,” answered Dave. “I am going to try to
locate that schooner first.”
</p>
<p>
“No, I’ll wait too, then,” said Roger.
</p>
<p>
The shipping along the St. John’s River at Jacksonville
is rather extensive. But Dunston Porter
knew his business and went direct to one of the
offices where he knew he could find out all about
the ships going out under charter and otherwise.
</p>
<p>
“We want to find out about a schooner named
the <em>Emma Brown</em>, or <em>Black</em>, or <em>Jones</em>, or some
common name like that,” said Dave’s uncle, to the
elderly man in charge. “She was in this harbor
several days ago. I don’t know if she has sailed
or not.”
</p>
<p>
“<em>Emma Brown</em>, eh?” mused the shipping-clerk.
“Never heard of such a schooner.”
</p>
<p>
“Maybe she was the <em>Emma Black</em>, or <em>Emma
Jones</em>,” suggested Dave.
</p>
<p>
“No schooner by that name here,—at least
not for the past month or two. We had an <em>Emma
Blackney</em> here about six weeks ago. But she sailed
for Nova Scotia.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, try to think of some ship that might be
named something like what we said,” pleaded
Dave. “This is very important.”
</p>
<p>
“A ship that might have sailed from here in
the past two or three days,” added Roger.
</p>
<p>
The elderly shipping-clerk leaned back in his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156'></a>156</span>
chair and ran his hand through his hair, thoughtfully.
</p>
<p>
“Maybe you’re looking for the <em>Emma
Brower</em>,” he said. “But she isn’t a schooner,
she’s a bark. She left this port yesterday morning.”
</p>
<p>
“Bound for where?” asked Dave, eagerly.
</p>
<p>
“Bound for Barbados.”
</p>
<p>
“Where is that?” questioned Phil. “I’ve
heard of the place, but I can’t just locate it.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s an island of the British West Indies,”
answered Dunston Porter. “It lies about five hundred
miles southeast of Porto Rico.”
</p>
<p>
“If that’s the case, then good-by to Merwell
and Jasniff,” murmured Phil. “We’ll never catch
them in the wide world.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157'></a>157</span><a name='chXVII' id='chXVII'></a>CHAPTER XVII—MEETING OLD FRIENDS</h2>
<p>
“They may have gone on some other vessel,”
remarked Roger, after a pause. “Let us find out
what other ships have left here during the past
few days.”
</p>
<p>
“Say,” said Phil, to the elderly shipping-clerk.
“Maybe you know my father or some of the
captains working for him. His name is Lawrence,
of the Lawrence Lines.”
</p>
<p>
“Indeed!” cried the shipping-clerk. “Well,
of course I know him! Are you Phil Lawrence?”
he questioned, eagerly.
</p>
<p>
“I am.”
</p>
<p>
“Now isn’t that strange!” The man put out
his hand. “I don’t suppose you know me. My
name is Sam Castner. I was once a supercargo
for your father, on the <em>Arvinus</em>. You took a trip
in her with your mother, when you were about ten
years old,—down to Tampa and back, from Philadelphia.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s right, so I did!” cried the shipowner’s
son. “I remember you now. We went fishing
together.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158'></a>158</span>
</p>
<p>
“So we did, Mr. Lawrence. My, how you’ve
grown since then!” added the former supercargo,
as he gazed at Phil’s tall and well-built form.
</p>
<p>
“Mr. Castner, we are in a hurry, and maybe
you can help us a good deal,” went on Phil. “We
are after two fellows who we think sailed in
that schooner, or bark, or some vessel that left
here within the past two days. They were young
fellows, not much older than us boys. Will you
aid us in getting on their track?”
</p>
<p>
“Sure I will,” was the ready answer. “What
do you know about ’em?”
</p>
<p>
“All we know is that they went under the
names of Leeds and Cross,” answered Dave.
“But those are not their right names.”
</p>
<p>
“And that they are supposed to have sailed on
the ship known by a common name—<em>Emma</em> something
or other,” put in Roger.
</p>
<p>
“I can soon find out who sailed on the <em>Emma
Brower</em>” answered Sam Castner. “Come with
me to the next shipping office.”
</p>
<p>
He called another clerk to take charge, and
accompanied the party to the next shipping office.
On the way he was introduced to Dave and the
others.
</p>
<p>
“One of your father’s vessels is in this harbor
now,” he said to Phil.
</p>
<p>
“What ship is that?”
</p>
<p>
“The <em>Golden Eagle</em>, Captain Sanders.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159'></a>159</span>
</p>
<p>
“Captain Sanders!” cried Dave. “Do you
mean Bob Sanders, who used to sail on the <em>Stormy
Petrel</em> with Captain Marshall?”
</p>
<p>
“The same, Mr. Porter. Then you know
him?”
</p>
<p>
“Indeed I do!” returned Dave. “Why, I
sailed with him in the South Seas!”
</p>
<p>
“Well, he’s here.”
</p>
<p>
“We’ll have to try to see him before we leave,”
said Phil. “He was a nice fellow.”
</p>
<p>
At the second shipping office further inquiries
were made concerning the sailing of the <em>Emma
Brower</em>. It was learned that the bark had carried
not more than half a cargo for Barbados
and eight passengers. The names of Merwell,
Jasniff, Leeds, or Cross did not appear on the
passenger list.
</p>
<p>
“Did anybody here see those passengers?”
asked Dunston Porter.
</p>
<p>
“I did,” returned a young clerk. “I was
aboard just before she sailed, and I saw all of
them.”
</p>
<p>
“Were there two young fellows, chums?”
asked Dave.
</p>
<p>
“There were, two tall chaps, a bit older than
you.”
</p>
<p>
“Did they look like these fellows?” and now
our hero brought out the photographs he had used
before.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160'></a>160</span>
</p>
<p>
“They certainly did!” cried the clerk. “I
remember this fellow distinctly,” and he pointed
to Jasniff’s picture, taken just before that individual
had run away from Oak Hall.
</p>
<p>
“Then they sailed, just as we feared!” returned
Dave, and there was something like a groan
in his voice.
</p>
<p>
“Wonder if they took the jewels,” murmured
Roger.
</p>
<p>
“Most likely, Roger,” answered Dunston Porter.
</p>
<p>
“But what would they do with them in such an
out-of-the-way place as Barbados?”
</p>
<p>
“I rather imagine their plan is to keep quiet
for a while, until this affair blows over. Then
they’ll either return to the United States, or take
a British vessel for England. Barbados is an
English possession, you must remember, and a
regular line of steamers sail from there to England.”
</p>
<p>
“I wonder if we couldn’t charter a steam tug
and go after the bark?” mused Dave.
</p>
<p>
“It might be done,” returned his uncle. “But
I doubt if we could catch the bark, or even locate
her. She has too much of a start.”
</p>
<p>
“Was the bark going to stop at any ports
along the way?” asked Phil.
</p>
<p>
“She was not,” answered the young shipping-clerk.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161'></a>161</span>
</p>
<p>
“Then there is nothing to do but to sail for
Barbados after them!” cried Dave.
</p>
<p>
“Sail after them—that far!” ejaculated the
senator’s son.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, Roger. Of course you haven’t got to go,
or Phil either. But I think my uncle and I ought
to go after ’em. Don’t you think so, Uncle Dunston?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know—perhaps,” was the slow reply.
“We had better make a few more inquiries first,
Dave.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes, let us find out all we can about Merwell
and Jasniff.”
</p>
<p>
They left the shipping office and walked back
to the hotel. Here they had a late breakfast and
then commenced to make diligent inquiries concerning
all the movements of Merwell and Jasniff.
They soon learned that the pair had had
plenty of money to spend, and that they had
bought many things for the trip to Barbados,
even taking along an extra supply of the Turkish
cigarettes that came in the boxes with bands of
blue and gold.
</p>
<p>
“I think that that proves my clew of the cigarette
box is correct,” said Dave.
</p>
<p>
They visited the local pawnbrokers, and from
one of them learned that Merwell had pawned
two diamonds for two hundred and fifty dollars.
The rascal had told the pawnbroker that the gems
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162'></a>162</span>
were the property of a rich lady who was awaiting
a remittance from France.
</p>
<p>
“Do these diamonds belong to the Carwith collection?”
asked Roger.
</p>
<p>
“That remains to be found out,” answered
Dunston Porter, and then he told the pawnbroker
to be sure and not let the gems go out of his
possession until a further investigation could be
made. The man grumbled somewhat, but when
Dave’s uncle spoke about calling in the officers of
the law, he subsided.
</p>
<p>
“Very well, I’ll keep them,” he said. “And if
anything is wrong, I’ll do what the law requires,
even if I lose by it.”
</p>
<p>
“Let us visit the <em>Golden Eagle</em> and see Bob
Sanders,” said Phil, late in the afternoon. “Perhaps
he knows something about the <em>Emma Brower</em>,
and her trip.”
</p>
<p>
The others were willing, and sundown found
them aboard the vessel belonging to Phil’s father.
Hardly had they stepped on deck when a grizzled
old tar, with white hair, rushed up to Dave.
</p>
<p>
“If it ain’t Dave Porter!” he burst out. “Yes,
sir, Dave, wot I haven’t seen in a year o’ Sundays!
How be you, my boy?” And he caught the youth
by both hands.
</p>
<p>
“Billy Dill!” exclaimed our hero, as his face
lit up with pleasure. “Where in the world did
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163'></a>163</span>
you drop from? I thought you had given up the
sea.”
</p>
<p>
Billy Dill, as my old readers will remember,
was the tar who aided Dave in locating his Uncle
Dunston. As related in “Dave Porter in the
South Seas,” Billy Dill had traveled with our hero
to that portion of the globe, in the <em>Stormy Petrel</em>,
of which Bob Sanders was, at the time, second
mate. On returning home, the old tar had been
placed in a sanitarium and then a sailors’ home,
and Dave had imagined he was still in the latter
retreat.
</p>
<p>
“Couldn’t give up the sea, Dave,” replied the
old sailor. “I tried my best, but it wasn’t no use.
So I goes to Phil’s old man, an’ I says, says I,
‘Give me a berth an’ anything I’m wuth,’ an’ he
says, says he, ‘How would ye like to sail with
Cap’n Sanders, wot sailed with you to the South
Seas?’ ‘Fust-rate,’ says I; an’ here I be, an’ likes
it very much.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I’m glad to see you looking so well,”
answered Dave.
</p>
<p>
“It’s the sea air done it, lad. When I was
ashore I jest knowed I wanted sea air. No more
homes ashore fer Billy Dill, not much!” And the
old tar shook his head with conviction.
</p>
<p>
A few minutes later, while the old sailor was
shaking hands with the others, and asking and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164'></a>164</span>
answering questions, the captain of the ship came
up.
</p>
<p>
“Very glad indeed to see you again,” said
Captain Sanders, with a broad smile. He looked
closely at the boys. “Grown some since I saw you
last.”
</p>
<p>
“And you have advanced, too,” answered Dave,
with a grin. “Let me congratulate you on becoming
a captain, Mr. Sanders.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s all through the kindness of Mr. Lawrence
and Captain Marshall. If it wasn’t for them, I
shouldn’t be in this berth.”
</p>
<p>
“How is Captain Marshall?” asked our hero.
The man mentioned was the commander of the
ship in which Dave had sailed to the South
Seas.
</p>
<p>
“First-rate, the last I heard of him. He sailed
from San Francisco to Manila ten days ago.”
</p>
<p>
“Captain Sanders, what port are you bound
for next?” questioned Phil, after greetings had
been exchanged all around and a number of other
questions had been asked.
</p>
<p>
“No port as yet, Phil. I’m waiting for orders.”
</p>
<p>
“Have you any idea where you may go to?”
</p>
<p>
“Something was said about a cargo for Porto
Rico. But nothing was settled. I’ll know in a
couple of days, I think.”
</p>
<p>
“Do any of our ships ever sail to Barbados?”
</p>
<p>
“Not very often. I could have had a cargo
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165'></a>165</span>
for that port from here, but the firm didn’t take
it, and it went to the <em>Emma Brower</em>.”
</p>
<p>
“The very ship we are after!” murmured
Dave.
</p>
<p>
“Could you get another cargo for Barbados,
do you think?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know—maybe. Why?”
</p>
<p>
“We want to go there!”
</p>
<p>
“You do! That isn’t much of a place.”
</p>
<p>
“But we have a reason for wanting to go,”
went on Phil. And then, knowing he could trust
Captain Sanders, he told the story of the stolen
gems and the search for Merwell and Jasniff.
</p>
<p>
“Humph! that’s a queer yarn,” mused the captain
of the <em>Golden Eagle</em>. “Supposing I got a
cargo for that port—you’d go along?”
</p>
<p>
“I would,” answered the shipowner’s son,
promptly. “That is, if dad would let me—and
I’m sure he would.”
</p>
<p>
“So would I go,” added Dave.
</p>
<p>
“I’d have to go—to look after the others,” said
Dunston Porter, with a smile.
</p>
<p>
“Well, you can’t leave me in the cold,” came
from Roger. “If the rest went, I’d go too.”
</p>
<p>
“Come down to the cabin and talk it over,”
said Captain Sanders, and led the way across the
deck and down the companionway.
</p>
<p>
Once below they were invited to remain to supper
and did so. While at the meal the boys and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166'></a>166</span>
Dunston Porter told all they knew concerning the
case against Merwell and Jasniff, and the captain
told what he knew about the <em>Emma Brower</em> and
her commander.
</p>
<p>
“I am going to telegraph to my father about
this,” said Phil, a little later. “If this vessel can
get a cargo for Barbados she might as well sail
for that port as anywhere.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I’m willing,” answered Captain Sanders.
“When will you send word to him?”
</p>
<p>
“Right away—I’ll send him a telegram at
once.”
</p>
<p>
“I hope it turns out all right,” said Dave. “I
feel it is my duty to get after Merwell and Jasniff,
and do it as soon as possible.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167'></a>167</span><a name='chXVIII' id='chXVIII'></a>CHAPTER XVIII—OFF FOR BARBADOS</h2>
<p>
The next three days were busy ones for the
boys and Dunston Porter. Telegrams were sent
back and forth between Phil and his father, and
also between Dave and Mr. Wadsworth.
</p>
<p>
“Here is news!” cried our hero, after receiving
one of the messages. “Just listen to this.” And
he read the following, from the jewelry manufacturer:
</p>
<p style='margin-left: 2em;margin-right: 4em;'>
“Clew in Boston proved to be false, also clew
in New York. Hope you are on the right track
and get gems. Spare no expense if you feel you
are right.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“And here is a telegram from my dad,” said
Phil. “He tells us—Captain Sanders and myself—to
use our own judgment.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Can you get a cargo for Barbados, Phil?”
asked Roger.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“We can get a half-cargo.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“At once?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Yes, that is, inside of two days.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168'></a>168</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Then by all means take it, Phil!” cried Dave.
“I know Mr. Wadsworth will stand the extra
expense. And if he won’t, I know my father will.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Where is your Uncle Dunston?” questioned
the shipowner’s son.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“He’s out on a little business trip. He got a
telegram from New York that upset him somewhat.
I hope it isn’t anything serious,” added
Dave, soberly.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
The boys rushed off to talk the matter over with
Captain Sanders. They found the master of the
vessel at the shipping office, talking over the matter
of a cargo for Barbados.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Four men want to take passage with us, if we
go,” said the captain. “That will help pay for
the trip, since they are willing to pay good passage
money.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“We want you to take that half-cargo,” said
Phil, and explained matters.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“All right, if you say so,” answered Captain
Sanders. “But you had better speak to Mr. Porter
about it first.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Half an hour later Dunston Porter came driving
up in a cab. He was plainly excited.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I’ve got to go to New York at once,” he said.
“I must look after some valuable investments in
Wall Street. Do you think you boys can get along
alone?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I think we can, Uncle Dunston,” answered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169'></a>169</span>
Dave. “You know we are used to taking care of
ourselves,” and he smiled faintly.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Then go ahead and do as you think best.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“We want Captain Sanders to start for Barbados
as soon as he can,” went on our hero, and
told of the telegrams received.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
A general talk followed, lasting until Dunston
Porter had to ride away to catch the train for New
York.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“You must be right, and Merwell and Jasniff
must be guilty,” he said. “And if they are,
spare no expense in catching them. I think the
quicker you start for Barbados the better. And
as soon as you arrive do your best to locate the
rascals and have the authorities arrest them. And
above all things, keep your eyes open for the
jewels, for we need them much more than we need
to catch Merwell and Jasniff. To catch the rascals
and miss the gems will do us no good.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I understand, Uncle Dunston,” answered
Dave. “And if the jewels are anywhere around
we’ll locate them.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Then good-by and good luck!” finished
Dunston Porter, and in a minute more he was off.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
As soon as he was gone the boys and Captain
Sanders commenced preparations for the trip to
Barbados. An extra number of longshoremen
were engaged, so that the half-cargo to be taken
along could be gotten aboard quickly, and the boys
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170'></a>170</span>
spent their time in buying such things as they
needed for the trip.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“They tell me it is pretty warm down there,”
said Roger. “So we had better buy some thin
suits.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“And we had better go armed,” added Phil.
“No telling what trouble we may run into, in
trying to corner Merwell and Jasniff. Merwell
is no great fighter, but Jasniff is a brute.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Yes, I’ll take no chances with Jasniff,” answered
Dave. He had not forgotten his quarrel
at Oak Hall with that bully, and how Jasniff had
attacked him with an Indian club, as related in
detail in “Dave Porter’s Return to School.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
At last all was in readiness for the trip, and the
boys and the other passengers, four burly Englishmen,
went aboard. Fortunately, the <em>Golden
Eagle</em> was well provided with staterooms, so there
was but little crowding. Dave had a small room
to himself and next to him were his chums, with
Captain Sanders and the first mate opposite.
Billy Dill was, of course, in the forecastle with
the other sailors.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“It’s grand to have you along ag’in,” he said,
to Dave and Phil. “Seems like old times, when
we sailed the Pacific.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“So it does,” answered our hero.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Only ye ain’t a-lookin’ for no uncle this trip,
be you?” And the old tar chuckled.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171'></a>171</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“No, Billy, we are looking for somebody quite
different—two rascals who ran away with a lot of
diamonds.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Mackerel an’ codfish! Ye don’t tell me,
Dave! Your diamonds?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“No, but some diamonds that were left with
a close friend of mine. If they are not recovered,
my friend will be almost ruined.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Jumpin’ dogfish! Then I hope you catch
them lubbers! If so be I can help ye any, don’t
be afeered to call on me,” added the old sailor,
earnestly.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“All right; I’ll remember that,” replied
Dave.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Early the next day the <em>Golden Eagle</em> slipped
down the St. John’s River and past the jetties
and the lighthouse into the Atlantic Ocean. It
was warm and clear, with a good wind blowing
from the west, an ideal day for the departure.
The boys remained on deck, watching the scenery
of the winding stream and then the fading shoreline,
and then went below to arrange their belongings,
for the trip to Barbados would occupy some
time.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I hope we don’t get seasick,” remarked the
senator’s son.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Well, if we do, we’ll have to stand it,” replied
Phil. “But don’t let’s think about it.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“What I am wishing, is that we’ll have good
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172'></a>172</span>
weather and a quick passage,” remarked Dave.
“We can’t get to Barbados any too quick for me.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I was looking up the place in the shipping-guide,”
went on Roger. “It’s not much of an
island, only twenty-one miles long by fifteen wide.
The whole population is only about two hundred
thousand, mostly English.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“The smaller the population the easier it will
be to find Merwell and Jasniff,” was the comment
of the shipowner’s son.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Well, there may be a good many hiding-places
on an island twenty-one miles long by fifteen
miles wide,” added Dave, with a grin.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh, we’ll rake the island with a fine-tooth
comb, if we have to,” cried Roger.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Roger, was your father quite willing to let
you go on the trip?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Yes. He and mother are now in Washington,
you know, and as the school is closed, I’d either
have to go to the Capital, or stay with you. And
I told him I’d much rather be with you and
Phil.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“And we are glad to have you with us!” cried
Phil, and Dave nodded, to show that he felt the
same way about it.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“What do you think about the other passengers?”
asked Phil, in a lower voice, so that nobody
else might hear.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I don’t think I’ll like them very much,” replied the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173'></a>173</span>
senator’s son. “That man named Geswick
is very loud and dictatorial.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Yes, and the chap named Pardell is little better,”
returned Dave.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“What line are they in, Phil, did you hear?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh, they are traveling, that’s all. They came
to this country from London, and they are going
back by the way of Barbados.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“They seem to have some money.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Yes, but Captain Sanders told me that they
hang on to it pretty well—more so than he at
first expected they would.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
The first day passed rapidly and the <em>Golden
Eagle</em> made good headway. The boys spent most
of the time on deck, amusing themselves as best
they could. They talked to Captain Sanders and
his mate, and also visited with Billy Dill. Occasionally
they conversed with the four Englishmen,
but they noticed that the Britishers were inclined
to keep to themselves.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I guess it is just as well, too,” said Dave to
his chums. “They are not our sort at all.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Unless I miss my guess, they have had some
sort of quarrel among themselves,” remarked
Phil. “They were disputing over something early
this morning and again just before dinner.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Several days passed, and the boys commenced
to feel quite at home on the ship. None of them
had been seasick, for which all were thankful.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174'></a>174</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“The weather has been in our favor,” said
Captain Sanders. “If it keeps on like this, we’ll
make Barbados in record time.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Billy Dill said he smelt a storm,” returned
Dave.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Hum! Is that so?” mused the captain.
“Well, he’s a pretty good weather-sharp, I must
confess. I’ll take another look at the glass,”
and he walked off to do so.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
The storm came up during the night, and Dave
was awakened to find himself rolling from one
side of his berth to the other. He arose, and as
he did so he heard an exclamation from Roger.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“What is it, Roger?” he called out.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I—I guess I’m seasick!” answered the senator’s
son. “Gracious, how this old tub rolls!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Don’t call the <em>Golden Eagle</em> a tub!” returned
Phil. “Say, can I do anything for you?”
he went on sympathetically.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Yes, tell Captain Sanders to keep the boat
from rocking.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Better lie down again, Roger,” said Dave,
entering the stateroom. “It’s a little better than
standing up.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh, I—I guess I’m not so very ba-badly
off,” gasped the sufferer. “But I do wish the
storm was over.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“We all wish that.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
But, instead of clearing away, the storm increased
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175'></a>175</span>
in violence, and by nine o’clock in the
morning the wind was blowing close to a gale.
Both the captain and the mate were on deck, and
the former advised the boys and the other passengers
to remain below. Two of the Englishmen
were very seasick and found all manner of fault
because of the storm.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I’d never have come on this treasure hunt had
I known I was to be so sick!” groaned one.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“What bloody luck!” said the other sick man.
“All the pirates’ gold in the world is not worth
it!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Stow it!” cried the man named Geswick.
“You know you weren’t to mention what we were
after.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Nobody can hear us, in this storm,” replied
the first man who had spoken.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Those boys might hear,” put in the fellow
named Pardell.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh, well, they are only boys. Besides, they’d
not dare to follow us up to Cave Island——”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Hush, I tell you!” cried Geswick, savagely.
“Do learn to keep your tongue quiet.” And then
the men continued to talk in whispers.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Dave had been passing the staterooms of the
Englishmen during this conversation and he could
not help but hear what was said. When he rejoined
his chums he told them of the talk.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“They must be on the hunt after pirates’ gold,”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176'></a>176</span>
said Phil. “Well, they are not the first to do that
kind of searching. Party after party has sailed
down here for the same purpose.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Yes, and each party has been unsuccessful, so
far as I know,” answered Dave.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Perhaps they have some extra-good clew,”
suggested Roger, trying to forget his seasickness.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Perhaps,” returned Dave. “Well, if they
can find any pirates’ gold on any of these islands
they are welcome to it, so far as I am concerned.
All I want to get hold of are the Carwith jewels.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177'></a>177</span><a name='chXIX' id='chXIX'></a>CHAPTER XIX—THE MISSING SHIP</h2>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“How much longer do you think this storm
will last?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
It was Dave who asked this question, of Captain
Sanders, when the latter came down to get a
bite for breakfast. To get a regular meal, with
the vessel pitching and tossing wildly, was out of
the question.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I don’t know, Dave,” was the grave answer.
“I am hoping the wind will die down by sunset.
But the storm may last several days.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Are we in any danger?” questioned Phil.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“There is always danger during a storm,” answered
the master of the <em>Golden Eagle</em>. “But
I hope to weather this blow without much trouble.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Can we be of any assistance?” went on our
hero.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“No, boys. There is nothing you can do but
keep yourselves from falling overboard. How is
Roger?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“A little better.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I heard that two of those Englishmen are
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178'></a>178</span>
pretty sick,” went on Captain Sanders, with a faint
smile.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“They are.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“It’s queer to me that they sailed with us.
It’s not such a pleasant voyage.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I overheard a little of their talk,” answered
Dave, and, knowing he could trust the captain,
he related what had been said.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Pirates’ gold, eh?” muttered the master of
the ship. “Most of those yarns are fairy-stories.
I’ve known expedition after expedition to be fitted
out, to search for treasures said to be hidden by
the old-time buccaneers, but I never saw a man
yet who got even a smell of a treasure. Where
were they going for it, Dave?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I don’t know. I think one of them mentioned
Cave Island. Is there such a place?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“There may be, although I never heard of it.
Many of the islands in this part of the globe,
being of volcanic origin, contain caves.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“They must expect to get to Cave Island from
Barbados.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“More than likely,” answered the captain, and
then hurried on deck again.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
The storm continued for the remainder of the
day, but by nightfall the wind commenced to die
down, and by midnight the clouds had passed and
the stars were shining brightly. In the morning
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179'></a>179</span>
the big sun came out of the sea to the east like
a globe of fire.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Now we are going to have some warm
weather,” remarked Billy Dill, and the old tar was
right. As the sun mounted in the heavens it grew
positively hot, until the boys had to go to their
staterooms and don thinner clothing. With the
departure of the storm, Roger’s seasickness left
him, but the two Englishmen remained slightly
unwell for some time longer.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Phew! how warm it is!” remarked Phil.
“And just think of it!—up at home they are having
snow and ice!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
With the passing of the storm, the boys settled
down as before. They saw but little of the Englishmen,
especially of the pair who were sick. But
one day something happened which came close to
causing a crisis.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
The boys were seated on the rear deck, talking
over matters in general, when a strong puff of
wind caused a sheet of paper to blow from somewhere
ahead towards Dave. He reached out and
caught the sheet just as it was about to go overboard.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Hello, what’s this?” he cried, as he looked
the sheet over. “Must be some sort of a chart.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“It is,” answered Roger, gazing at the paper.
“See, here is a spot marked Barbados, and another marked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180'></a>180</span>
Cave Island, a little to the eastward.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Why, look what it says, up here!” cried
Phil. “’<em>Map of the Don Amorandos Treasure,
buried in 1715</em>.’ Say, do you think those Englishmen——”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Hi, you! Give me that map!” bawled a
voice from near by, and with a very red face, the
Englishman named Geswick bore down on the
boys. “How dare you look at this?” he went
on, as he snatched the sheet out of their hands
and folded it up.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“We wanted to see what it was and whom it
belonged to,” answered Dave, as calmly as he
could.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“You had no right to look at it,” stormed Andrew
Geswick. “That is private property.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Then why did you let it fall in our hands?”
asked Phil.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“If it hadn’t been for Dave, it would have
gone overboard,” put in Roger.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Humph!” The man fell back a little.
“Well, I am thankful for that. But you boys
had no right to look at it,” he grumbled.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Why, it’s only a chart, isn’t it?” asked the
senator’s son, curiously.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Never mind what it is!” answered Andrew
Geswick, sharply. “Did you read what was on
it?” he demanded, an instant later.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181'></a>181</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“We saw it was a chart,” answered Dave, and
looked knowingly at his chums, to make them
keep silent.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“It—er—it belongs to Mr. Pardell and he is
very particular about it,” went on the Englishman.
And then without another word he walked
away.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“My, isn’t he sweet!” muttered Phil.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Just as sweet as a can of sour milk,” answered
the senator’s son. “Dave, I guess you
wish you had allowed that map to blow overboard.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Not exactly that, Roger. But he might have
been a little more thankful for saving something
that he thinks so valuable.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Do you think there is anything in this treasure
idea?” questioned Phil, after a pause.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“No, Phil. That is, there may be some lost
treasure, secreted by the pirates and buccaneers of
old, but I doubt if anybody will ever find it—excepting
by accident.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“If there was a treasure on this Cave Island,
we might hunt for it,” went on the shipowner’s
son.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Phil, don’t let that bee get into your bonnet!”
cried Roger. “Many a man has gone
crazy looking for pirates’ gold. Better drop it,
and think of how we are to round up Merwell and
Jasniff.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182'></a>182</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Well, I’d like to go to Cave Island anyway,”
said Phil. “We might——” And then he
stopped short, as he saw Geswick and Pardell
near by. The Englishmen had been listening to
part of the conversation.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“So you’d like to go to Cave Island, would
you?” cried Andrew Geswick, his face red with
rage. “You take my advice and keep away from
that place!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Say, do you own that island?” demanded
Phil, getting angry because of the other’s dictatorial
manner.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“No, we don’t own the island. But we——”
Andrew Geswick stopped short as his companion
plucked him by the sleeve. “Never mind, you
keep away from it, that’s all,” he growled.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“We’ll go there if we want to,” called out
Phil.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“If you do you may get into trouble,” called
back Pardell. Then he and his companion disappeared
in the direction of the cabin.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“They are touchy enough,” was Roger’s comment.
“Phil, you had better drop Cave Island
after this.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I’ll talk about it as much as I please,” grumbled
the shipowner’s son. “Those fellows make
me tired. They act as if they owned the
earth!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183'></a>183</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Sunday was a quiet day on shipboard. The
Englishmen did not show themselves excepting at
meals, and the boys were content to leave them
severely alone. They told Captain Sanders of the
chart and of the talk that had occurred.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Let them alone, lads,” said the commander
of the <em>Golden Eagle</em>. “I’ll venture to say that
sooner or later they’ll find out they are on a wild
goose chase.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“The only one that seems to be anyway nice
is the fellow named Giles Borden,” said Dave.
“He is rather quiet. The other fellow, Rumney,
is almost as bad as Geswick and Pardell.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“So I’ve noticed, Dave. And the queer part
of it is, Borden paid for the passages. He appears
to be the only one with money.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Maybe he is backing the expedition,” suggested
Roger.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I’m sorry for him if he is,” answered the
captain.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
The Bahama Islands had been passed, and now
they were in the vicinity of Porto Rico. Then
commenced the trip southward, through the
Lesser Antilles.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“This is the spot for active volcanoes,” observed
Phil. “Don’t you remember how the
Island of Martinique suffered?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh, don’t speak of volcanoes!” cried Roger.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184'></a>184</span>
“I have no use for them—or for earthquakes
either.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“There must be hundreds of islands around
here,” observed Dave. “The charts are full of
them.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“That must make navigation difficult,” came
from Phil.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh, I reckon Captain Sanders knows what he
is about.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Wonder how soon we’ll run into the harbor
at Bridgetown?” mused the shipowner’s son, the
place he mentioned being the main seaport of
Barbados.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Inside of three days, I hope, Phil,” answered
our hero.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Merwell and Jasniff must be there by this
time.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“It’s more than likely—unless something happened
to delay them,” returned Dave.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
At last came the day when they sighted Barbados
and ran into the harbor of Bridgetown.
The place was a picturesque one, but the boys
had just then no time to view the scenery or the
shipping. As soon as it could be accomplished,
they went ashore, and Captain Sanders went with
them, leaving his vessel in charge of the first
mate.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“You may have trouble with those two rascals,
if you find them,” said the commander of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185'></a>185</span>
<em>Golden Eagle</em>. “I’ll be on deck to help you all
I can.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Shall we go to the hotel first?” questioned
Roger.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Might as well,” answered Phil. “They’d
strike for the hotel first thing, after a sea trip
like that. Maybe they were both seasick.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I hope they were—it would serve them right,”
growled the senator’s son.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Dave and the captain were willing, and a little
later walked into the Royal George Hotel. Here
the boys looked at the register, but found no
names that they could recognize. Then Dave
brought out his photographs of Merwell and
Jasniff and showed them to the hotel proprietor
and his clerk.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Nobody here that looks like either of them,”
said the proprietor, while his clerk also shook his
head.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“They came in on the <em>Emma Brower</em>,” said
Captain Sanders.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“The <em>Emma Brower</em>!” cried the hotel man.
“Is she in?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Why, I suppose so,” and now the commander
of the <em>Golden Eagle</em> showed his surprise.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“She wasn’t in last night, and the agents were a
bit worried about her. I know the agents personally,
you see.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Then maybe she isn’t in yet!” cried Dave.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186'></a>186</span>
“Let us go down to the docks and find out about
this.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
They lost no time in visiting the docks and the
shipping offices. There they learned that nothing
had been heard of the <em>Emma Brower</em> since the
vessel had left Jacksonville.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“We must have passed her on the way!” cried
Dave, to Captain Sanders. “Could we do that?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Perhaps, since we only had half a cargo,
Dave. Besides, maybe that vessel was damaged
by the storm.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I wonder how soon she will get in?” mused
Roger.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
At this the captain shrugged his shoulders.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“It is impossible to say. I’ve known a ship
to be a week and sometimes nearly a month overdue.
And I’ve known a ship to drop out altogether,”
he added, soberly.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh, don’t say you think she has gone down!”
cried Dave, in alarm.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Let us hope not, Dave.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
The day passed, and also the next and the next.
The cargo of the <em>Golden Eagle</em> was unloaded, and
the Englishmen, who had been passengers, left
for parts unknown. As each day slipped by, Dave
grew more serious. What if the <em>Emma Brower</em>
had gone down, carrying Merwell, Jasniff, and
the Carwith jewels with her?
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187'></a>187</span><a name='chXX' id='chXX'></a>CHAPTER XX—LANDING ON CAVE ISLAND</h2>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
At the end of a week Dave was more worried
than ever. Each day he and his chums went down
to the shipping offices and each day returned to
the hotel disappointed. Not a word had been
heard concerning the missing vessel and those on
board.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
The <em>Golden Eagle</em> was all ready to sail on her
return trip to the United States, but Phil told
Captain Sanders to wait.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Perhaps we’ll hear to-day,” he said, and this
was repeated day after day.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
It was very warm and the boys were glad they
had brought along some thin clothing. They
scarcely knew what to do with themselves, and
Dave was particularly sober.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I suppose Mr. Wadsworth and the rest are
waiting to hear from me,” he said to his chums.
“But what is the use of sending a message when
I haven’t anything to say?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Another Sunday passed, and on Monday the
boys visited the <em>Golden Eagle</em>, and then went with
Captain Sanders to the nearest shipping office.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188'></a>188</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Something is going on!” cried the senator’s
son, as he noticed an unusual crowd congregated.
“Must be news of some sort.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Let us find out what it is!” returned our
hero, quickly.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“The <em>Emma Brower</em> has been heard from,”
said a man, standing near. “That’s the
vessel that was missing, don’t you know,” he
added.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“What of her?” asked Dave.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Went down in that terrible storm we had
about ten days ago.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Down!” gasped all of the boys, while Captain
Sanders looked the concern he felt.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“So they say. I do not know the particulars,”
went on the man as he walked away.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
It did not take the boys and the captain long
to get into the shipping office and there they
learned as many of the particulars as were known.
A tramp steamer from Porto Rico had come in
bringing word that she had sighted portions of a
wreck while out at sea, and an investigation proved
the same to belong to the <em>Emma Brower</em>. A portion
of a small boat had been picked up, but nothing
had been seen of sailors or passengers.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Where was this?” questioned Dave, when
he could get the chance.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“The captain of the steamer says about two
miles west of Cave Island.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189'></a>189</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Cave Island!” cried Phil. “Why, that is
where those Englishmen were going to hunt for
that pirates’ treasure.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Two miles from Cave Island,” mused our
hero. “If the <em>Emma Brower</em> went down, perhaps
those in some of the small boats got to that
place.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Perhaps,” answered Captain Sanders.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
The boys and the captain remained at the shipping
office for an hour, getting all the details possible
concerning the wreck, including the exact
latitude and longitude where the vessel was supposed
to have gone down.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Let us sail for that spot and see if we can
discover anything,” suggested Dave, as the party
came away. “We may find some of those in the
small boats.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Just what I was going to suggest,” said Phil.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Well, it’s up to you, Phil, to say what we
shall do,” answered Captain Sanders. “Your
father sent me word that I was to look to you for
orders—that is, within reasonable limits,—and I
know you won’t be unreasonable.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Well, we want to get back to the United
States, anyway,” said Roger. “And this would
be on our way.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“How soon can you get ready for the trip?”
asked our hero, of the master of the <em>Golden
Eagle</em>.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190'></a>190</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“We are all provisioned, so it won’t take but
a few hours,” was the reply.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Then let us sail to-day.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“You don’t want to wait for more word?”
asked Roger.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“No, Roger; I don’t think it will do any good,”
answered our hero.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
The matter was discussed at the hotel, and a
little later the boys paid their bill and had their
baggage taken to the ship. In the meantime Captain
Sanders had prepared for the trip, and two
hours later the <em>Golden Eagle</em> was moving out of
the harbor of Bridgetown.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“How long will it take us to run to that spot
where they think the ship went down?” asked
Phil.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Not more than a day and a half—it depends
somewhat on the wind,” answered Captain Sanders.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
The boys tried to settle themselves, but this
was impossible. Dave could not keep still, and
paced the deck by the hour, or scanned the bosom
of the ocean with the marine glasses Captain Sanders
loaned him.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Only once came a thrill of excitement. A bit of
wreckage was sighted and the ship sailed toward
it. It was a yardarm, and to it were lashed a
cask and several boxes, one of the latter bearing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191'></a>191</span>
the name <em>Emma Brower</em>. Not a sign of a human
being could be seen.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“If a man was on that wreckage the storm
tore him loose,” said Captain Sanders.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“How terrible!” whispered Roger.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“And think of it, it may have been Merwell,
or Jasniff, or both of them!” returned Phil.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
On the following day they reached the latitude
and longitude as given by the captain of the tramp
steamer. In that vicinity they saw some smaller
wreckage, but nothing of importance.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Cave Island is two miles east of here,” said
Captain Sanders.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Any other islands around?” asked Dave.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Nothing within fifteen or twenty miles.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Then, if the crew and passengers took to the
small boats, wouldn’t they be likely to steer for
Cave Island?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I think so,—that is, if the storm let ’em do so.
It might be the wind would force ’em the other
way. But I think it would be a wise move to
sail for Cave Island and take a look around. The
one trouble is, so I learned at Barbados, the island
hasn’t any sort of harbor. We’ll have to lay-to
outside and go ashore in a small boat.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Perhaps it won’t be necessary to go ashore,”
said Roger.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh, it can be done easily enough.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192'></a>192</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
The bow of the <em>Golden Eagle</em> was turned
eastward. They ran slowly, all hands keeping
their eyes open for more signs of the wreck.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Presently they came in sight of the reef outside
of Cave Island. It formed a large horseshoe,
and beyond was the island itself, long, low,
and irregular, the shore fringed with tropical trees
and bushes and the center rocky and barren.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“This ain’t no easy place to land,” said Billy
Dill to Dave, as the sails were lowered and the
ship was brought about. “If them critters from
the wreck got here in their small boats in the dark
they must have had a fierce time o’ it!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I don’t see a sign of a boat anywhere,” said
Dave, as he swept the reef and the shore with the
glasses. “And not a sign of a human being
either,” he added, with a sinking heart.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“That’s queer, too, lad, if they came here.
Fust thing I’d think about, if I was wrecked, would
be to put up a signal o’ distress.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
It was growing dark, yet Dave and his chums
were anxious to go ashore, to see if they could
discover anything concerning those who had been
wrecked, so Captain Sanders ordered out the largest
of the small boats.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I’ll go with you,” he said. “And we can take
Billy Dill and Smiley.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“We had better take some things along—in
case we remain ashore all night,” said Dave.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193'></a>193</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“To be sure. And we’ll go armed, lad—no
telling what may turn up.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Any wild animals here?” questioned the
senator’s son.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I don’t know, but I don’t think so—that is,
not large ones. You’ll find rabbits maybe, and
any number of birds.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Soon the small boat was ready to go ashore.
Billy Dill and the other sailor, Smiley, were at
the oars, while Captain Sanders was in the stern,
to steer and give directions.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“If it starts to blow better move off a bit,” said
the captain to the mate. “No use in taking
chances around these reefs.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I’ll watch out,” was the answer. “I know
just what a blow down here means, and I’ll keep
her off.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Do you think we’ll have another storm?”
asked Dave.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Can’t tell about that, lad. Sometimes a storm
comes up pretty quick in these parts.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Soon the small boat was close to the breakers.
The water boiled and foamed on every side, and
it must be confessed that Roger was somewhat
scared. Dave and Phil did not mind, although
wishing it was over.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“To starboard, hard!” shouted the captain,
when the first of the breakers was encountered.
“Now ease off, lads! Lively now, and hard!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194'></a>194</span>
Starboard again! Keep it up! There, straight
ahead! Bend to it, bend I tell you! A little
more to starboard—not too much! There, now
we are out of it!” And in a moment more the
small boat was out of the breakers and riding into
a tiny cove, where there was a stretch of sand,
dotted with palms. The two sailors were all but
exhausted and glad enough to rest up and allow
the boat to drift ashore.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“So this is Cave Island?” remarked Dave, as
he hopped out on the sand, followed by his chums.
“Well, it doesn’t look much different from the
other islands in this portion of the globe.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
After everybody had alighted, the small boat
was pulled up on the sand and tied to a palm
tree.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“What’s to do next?” asked the shipowner’s
son, as he looked inquiringly at Dave. “This is
your expedition, Dave.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“How big around do you suppose this island
is, Captain?” asked our hero.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Four or five miles at least.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Then we could walk completely around it in
a couple of hours, that is, if we found it wasn’t
too rough in spots.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“You won’t find it smooth like this all around,
lad.”
</p>

<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Some of us might walk in one direction and
some in the other,” suggested Roger. “Then, if
either party discovered anything, it could signal
to the other by firing a pistol or a gun.” For both
sorts of weapons had been brought along.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Whatever you wish to do to-day must be done
quickly,” said Captain Sanders. “It will soon be
night, and, as you know, darkness comes on quickly
in this part of the world.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
The matter was discussed for a few minutes,
and then it was decided to leave the sailors in
charge of the boat, while Captain Sanders and
Phil walked up the shore and Dave and Roger
traveled in the opposite direction.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
For fully a quarter of a mile Dave and the
senator’s son found it an easy matter to push
along, for the sandy shore was smooth and offered
no barrier to their advance. But then they came
to a series of rocks, jutting out into the ocean,
and here progress was more difficult.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“We’ll not get around this island to-night,”
remarked the senator’s son, after climbing over
a particularly sharp line of rocks. “This takes
a fellow’s wind.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Look!” cried our hero, as he pointed to a
spot between the rocks. “What do you make that
out to be, Roger?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“It’s the wreck of a rowboat!” cried the
other.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Just what I thought. Let us go down and
look it over.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196'></a>196</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
With care, so as not to sprain an ankle, the
two chums climbed down to the split in the rocks.
By this time it was growing dark, and in the
hollow they could not see clearly.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
It was the remains of a rowboat which they had
discovered. The small craft was split from end
to end, so as to be utterly useless. Near it lay
a broken oar and a broken-open box that had
contained provisions of some sort.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“That boat is from the <em>Emma Brower</em>!”
cried Dave, after an investigation. “And that
proves that some of the people from the wrecked
ship came to this island!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Yes, but are they alive, Dave, or were they
drowned?” questioned Roger.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“That remains to be found out, Roger. I sincerely
hope they are alive.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197'></a>197</span><a name='chXXI' id='chXXI'></a>CHAPTER XXI—INTO A CAVE AND OUT</h2>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Let us look around for footprints, Roger,”
said Dave, as the pair scrambled up the rocks
once more. “If any persons landed from that
smashed rowboat they’d have to walk in some direction,
and the ground is soft back of here.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“The trouble is, it is growing so dark,” returned
the senator’s son. “In a little while we
won’t be able to find our way back. We should
have brought a lantern along.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I’ve got something almost as good,” answered
our hero, and took from his pocket a little electric
flashlight—one of the kind that emits a tiny flash
of light when the button at the end is pressed.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Good enough! That’s first-rate!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
The pair were soon down from the rocks. Under
the palm trees it was now dark, and Dave used
the electric flashlight to advantage.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Here are footprints!” he cried, presently.
“Six pairs! That shows that at least a half
dozen persons came ashore in that boat. Those
six may have been carrying others.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Shall we set up a shout?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198'></a>198</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I don’t know, Roger. If Merwell and Jasniff
were around I’d like to surprise them. If
they discovered us first, and they had the jewels,
they’d surely hide the gems and then say they
didn’t have them.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I believe that, Dave. Well, let us follow the
footsteps and see where they lead to.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Another thing. Do you remember those
Englishmen? They may be on this island, and
if so, I’d rather steer clear of them.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“So would I, they were so disagreeable—all but
that one chap, Borden.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
The trail led among the palm trees and then
up a rise of ground where grew a number of bushes.
Here the boys had to proceed more slowly, for
fear of missing the way.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“It’s queer that they should call this spot Cave
Island,” observed the senator’s son. “We haven’t
seen anything that looks like a cave.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“The caves may be on the other side of the
island,” answered Dave. “Look out, Roger,
there is a split in the rocks! Let us jump over to
yonder bushes.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Dave placed the flashlight in his pocket and
made the leap he had mentioned, and his chum
came after him.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
A most astonishing thing followed. The bushes
where they landed gave way, and down they rolled
on some smooth rocks. They tried to stay their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199'></a>199</span>
progress, but this was impossible, and they continued
to roll for several minutes. Then Dave
bumped into some sort of barrier and Roger
landed beside him.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“For gracious sake, what’s this?” gasped
Roger, when he felt able to speak. The breath
had been all but knocked out of him.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I guess we have found one of the caves,” answered
Dave, grimly. “Phew, but that was some
roll, wasn’t it!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“We must be down near the center of the
earth,” murmured the senator’s son.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Not quite as bad as that. But we came down
some distance, I admit.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Flash that light around, Dave, and let us see
where we are.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I will if the light hasn’t been smashed,” replied
our hero. “I rolled over it half a dozen
times.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
He brought out the little flashlight and tried it.
Fortunately, it was still in working order. As the
rays fell around the lads, they stared at each other,
blankly.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“What do you make of this, Dave?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Looks as if it was cut out of the solid rock,
Roger.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“It certainly is some cave. Wonder where it
leads to?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“We might follow the opening and find out.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200'></a>200</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Excuse me, I’d rather climb out the way we
came in.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“It certainly doesn’t look very inviting.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
The two boys found themselves in an irregular
opening of the rocks, fifty feet wide and perhaps
twice that in length. On one side was the smooth
slope down which they had come; on the other a
dark hole that looked as if it might lead to some
bottomless pit. A jagged rock in the center of the
underground chamber had been the means of stopping
them from dropping to the unknown depths
below them.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“We were lucky to hit this rock,” said Dave,
with something like a shiver. “If we hadn’t——”
He did not finish.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Let us get out. It gives me the creeps to stay
here,” returned his chum.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“All right, Roger, I’m willing. But it is going
to be hard work crawling back, those rocks are
so smooth.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“We’ve got to get back!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I can’t hold the light and climb too. And if
I place it on the rocks it may roll away and go
down into that hole,” went on our hero.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh, put it in your pocket again and we’ll try
to climb back in the dark. We know the direction.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Dave did as his chum suggested, and then commenced
a climb that neither of the lads ever forgot. The rocks
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201'></a>201</span>
were so smooth in spots that at
times to get a foothold was next to impossible.
Once Roger slid back several feet and would have
gone to the bottom had not Dave caught and held
him.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Take it slowly, Roger,” was our hero’s advice.
“If you go to the bottom, you may be
killed!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I’ll hang—on!” gasped the other. “But I
wi-wish I was out—of—th-this!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Well, I wish the same.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
It took fully a quarter of an hour longer to get
out of the rocky cave, and when the boys reached
the surface of the earth they were so exhausted
they could do little but sit on the ground and
pant for breath.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“It’s Cave Island right enough,” was the comment
of the senator’s son. “But excuse me from
tumbling into any more such openings!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I guess the best thing we can do is to go back
to the boat,” said Dave. “We can’t discover
much in this darkness. We can start out again
early in the morning.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“All right, back to the boat it is,” and the pair
set out on the return along the sandy shore.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I see a light!” cried Dave, after about half the
distance to where the rowboat had been left was
covered. And he pointed to a spot inland, among
the trees.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202'></a>202</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Maybe it’s a camp of some sort,” replied
Roger. “It seems to be quite a distance away.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Shall we go and see what it is?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Hadn’t we better get the others first, Dave?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“All right, if you think best.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
So they continued on the way to where the
rowboat had been left. They came up to find that
Captain Sanders and Phil had not yet returned.
Smiley was snoring on the sand, while Billy Dill
sat near by on guard.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Find anybody?” queried the old tar, eagerly.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“We found one of the caves, and we saw a
light at a distance,” answered Dave. “We want
to investigate that light, as soon as the others get
back.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Dave and Roger sat down, to rest and to wait,
and thus another half-hour went by. With nothing
else to do, Billy Dill took a nap, and the boys
allowed the old sailor to slumber on.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“It’s queer the captain and Phil don’t return,”
remarked Roger, presently. “They must have
gone much further than we did.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Maybe they fell into one of those caves,
Roger.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh, I trust not!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Another half-hour went by and still the others
did not put in an appearance. By this time Dave
was getting worried.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Let us take a walk along the shore and look
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203'></a>203</span>
for them,” he said, and Roger agreed, and they
started off.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
They had covered less than a quarter of a mile
when they came in sight of a campfire, well-hidden
between the rough rocks back from the water’s
edge. Around the campfire were huddled the
forms of several men, evidently sailors.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Perhaps those men are from the <em>Emma
Brower</em>,” said Dave, in a low tone.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I don’t see anything of Captain Sanders and
Phil,” remarked the senator’s son.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“No. And yet they must have seen this campfire,
if they came this way. What can it mean,
Dave?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I don’t know.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Shall we go up to the campfire and talk to
those fellows?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I don’t see why not. I am not afraid of
them.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Do you see anybody that looks like Jasniff or
Merwell?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“No, those fellows are all plain sailors, by their
outfits.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Dave continued to advance and Roger followed,
and neither halted until he was within the glow of
the campfire. Then Dave called out:
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Hello, messmates!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
At this cry the four sailors around the fire
sprang to their feet. At a glance Dave and Roger
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204'></a>204</span>
saw that they were in tatters, and that they looked
hungry and careworn.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Hello, yourself!” answered one of the
tars, stepping towards the boys. “Who are
you?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Passengers from the <em>Golden Eagle</em>,” answered
Dave.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh, some more of that crowd, eh?” cried
the tar.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Then you’ve seen the others,—the captain and
a young fellow like ourselves?” queried Roger.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Yes, they were here only a short while ago.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“They said they’d be back, and take us aboard
an’ git us something to eat,” put in a second of
the sailors.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“An’ we need that grub putty bad, we do,”
added a third.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Ain’t had no decent meal since we got
wrecked,” came from the fourth. “A few fish
an’ birds, an’ that’s all.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“You are from the <em>Emma Brower</em>?” questioned
Dave, eagerly.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“You’ve struck it, messmate. She went down in
the storm an’ we come putty nigh goin’ down with
her.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Well, you shall have all you want to eat in
a little while. Tell me where the others of our
crowd went.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“They went after the two chaps as ran away.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205'></a>205</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Ran away?” cried Dave. “From where?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“From here.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“They must have been Jasniff and Merwell!”
murmured Roger.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Who were those fellows?” asked our hero.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Two passengers from the bark. They came
ashore with us, and they stayed with us until your
captain and the other young fellow come along.
Then they up anchors and away like the old Nick
was after ’em,” explained the tar who had first
spoken.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Were they young fellows like ourselves?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Yes,—a bit older, maybe. Named Ford and
Smith.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“They must have been Jasniff and Merwell,”
said Dave, to his chum.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I wonder if they managed to save the jewels,”
whispered the senator’s son.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Did they have any baggage?” asked Dave
of the sailors.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Baggage? Not much! We didn’t have no
time for baggage when the ship went down. It
was every man fer himself. The cap’n got off
in one boat with some o’ the passengers, an’ the
mate got off with some of the crew in another
boat, an’ we got off by ourselves. It was blowin’
big guns, I can tell ye, an’ it looks like we would
be swamped most every minit. I knowed about
this island an’ I steered in this direction as well
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206'></a>206</span>
as I could, an’ by sheer good luck we struck the
shore—an’ here we are.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“What became of the other boats?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Ain’t seen nuthin’ of ’em yet.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Is that your boat was split in two, between the
rocks in that direction?” and Dave pointed to
where such a craft had been found by him and
Roger.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“That’s her, messmate. Putty badly used up,
eh?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“And you are quite sure those two passengers
had no baggage?” went on our hero, after a
pause.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Nary a thing, messmate, excepting wot they
wore. It wasn’t no time to think o’ baggage, it
was a time to think o’ what to do to save your
life!”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207'></a>207</span><a name='chXXII' id='chXXII'></a>CHAPTER XXII—THE HURRICANE</h2>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“What direction did those fellows who ran
away take?” asked Dave.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“That’s the way they went,” answered one of
the sailors, pointing to some heavy undergrowth
behind the camping-out spot.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Where does that lead to, do you know?”
asked the senator’s son.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Leads to a spring o’ fresh water an’ half a
dozen big caves,” was the reply.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Caves?” queried Dave. “Then perhaps the
fellows, who ran away, took to one of the caves.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Like as not, messmate. Them two chaps have
been explorin’ them caves ever since we came
ashore.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Let us walk back and have a look,” suggested
our hero. “We may be able to give Phil and
Captain Sanders some assistance.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Without further delay, the two boys left the
camp of the castaways and hurried along a small
trail through the bushes. They soon came to a
rocky depression in the midst of which was a tiny
spring.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208'></a>208</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“That water looks good,” exclaimed Dave.
“Let us get a drink.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Perhaps it is poisonous, Dave.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“If it was, I think those sailors would have
warned us.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
They found the water fairly cold and of a good
flavor, and each drank his fill. Then Dave flashed
the electric light around. Ahead they made out
a series of rocks, with here and there a gloomy
opening, leading to unknown depths.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“This is Cave Island and no mistake,” was our
hero’s comment. “The place seems to be fairly
honeycombed.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Be careful that you don’t go into a hole and
drop out of sight,” warned his chum.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
They walked to the entrance of one of the caves
and peered in. All was dark and silent. Then
they went to the next cave. Here they caught a
glimmer of light.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Somebody is moving in here!” exclaimed
Dave. “A man with a torch!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
They waited, and presently saw that two persons
were approaching slowly, having to pick their way
over the uneven rocks.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“They are the captain and Phil,” cried Roger,
and set up a faint call.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Hello! Who is that?” answered the captain
of the <em>Golden Eagle</em>.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Dave and Roger!” cried Phil. “Oh, say,”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209'></a>209</span>
he added, eagerly, “we’ve seen Jasniff and Merwell!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“So we suspected,” answered Dave. “But you
didn’t catch them?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“No, they got away from us,” returned Captain
Sanders.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“In this cave?” queried Roger.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Yes.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“But if they are in here, we can get them sooner
or later,” put in Dave.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“No, my lad. There are several openings to
these caves. We found one at the far end, and
I reckon those rascals got away through it.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Did you speak to them at all?” asked our
hero.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Didn’t get time,” answered Phil. “The minute
they saw us they ran like frightened deer.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Did they have any baggage, Phil?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Not that I could see. I rather fancied Jasniff
had a small bundle under his coat, but I may have
been mistaken.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“The sailors said they came ashore without
baggage. Perhaps the jewels went down with the
bark.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh, I think they’d make an effort to save such
costly gems—anybody would.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Not if they were thoroughly scared,” broke
in Captain Sanders. “A person who is thoroughly
scared forgets everything but to save his life.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210'></a>210</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Then you haven’t any idea where they went
to?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“No, lad. But I don’t think they’ll get off this
island in a hurry.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
There was nothing to do but to return to where
the four sailors were encamped. Then the whole
party proceeded to where Billy Dill and Smiley
had been left.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I don’t think it will be safe to try to get
through those breakers in the darkness,” said Captain
Sanders. “We may as well make ourselves
comfortable until morning. We have plenty of
grub on hand, so you fellows shall have your fill,”
he went on, to the castaways.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
The sailors were glad enough to build another
campfire, close to the landing-place, and here they
were served with all the food and drink they
wanted, which put them in good humor. They
related the particulars of how the <em>Emma Brower</em>
had gone down, and of how one boat after another
had put off in the storm. It had been a time of
great excitement, such as none of them were liable
to ever forget.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
The boys were worn out from their exertions
and willing enough to rest. They fixed up some
beds of boughs and were soon in the land of
dreams. The sailors rested also, each, however,
taking an hour at watching, by orders of Captain
Sanders.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211'></a>211</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
It was about five o’clock in the morning when
Dave awoke, to find the wind blowing furiously.
Two of the sailors were busy stamping out the
campfire, for the burning brands were flying in all
directions, threatening to set fire to the undergrowth.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“What’s this?” he asked of Captain Sanders.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“No telling, lad,” was the grave reply.
“Looks like a pretty big blow.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“More like a hurricane!” snorted old Billy
Dill. “The wind is growin’ wuss each minit!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Draw that boat up into the bushes and fasten
it well,” ordered the captain. “We don’t want
to have it stove in or floated off by the breakers.”
And the rowboat was carried to a place of
safety.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Where is the ship?” asked Roger.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Slipped away when the blow came up,” answered
the captain. “An’ I hope the mate knows
enough to keep away,” he added, gravely.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Soon it started to rain, first a few scattering
drops and then a perfect deluge. The castaways
spoke of a cave that was near by, and all hurried
in that direction, taking the stores from the boat
with them.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“How long will this last, do you think?” asked
Phil, of the master of the <em>Golden Eagle</em>.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“No telling. Maybe only to-day, maybe several
days.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212'></a>212</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“If it last several days, we’ll have a time of it
getting food,” broke in the senator’s son.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“We’ll watch out for fish and turtles,” said
Billy Dill. “Nothin’ like turtles when you are
good an’ hungry.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“That’s true,” answered Dave. He had not
forgotten the big turtle the old tar had managed to
catch down on one of the islands in the South
Seas.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Soon it was raining so hard that but little could
be seen beyond the entrance to the cave. The wind
moaned and shrieked throughout the cavern,
which happened to have several entrances. Once
it became so strong that it almost lifted the boys
from their feet. The rain drove in at times, and
they had to get into a split in the rocks to keep dry.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Hark! what was that?” cried Roger, during
a lull in the wind.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I heard thunder; that’s all,” answered Phil.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I think a tree must have been struck by lightning,”
answered Captain Sanders. “The lightning
is getting pretty fierce,” he added, as a brilliant
illumination filled the cavern.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Wonder where Jasniff and Merwell are?”
whispered Phil, to his chums, “I’ll wager this
storm scares ’em half to death.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Yes, and those four Englishmen,” added
Dave. “Don’t forget that they were coming to
this island.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213'></a>213</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Slowly the hours of the morning dragged by.
There was no let-up in the hurricane, for such it
really proved to be. The wind blew strongly all
the time, but occasionally would come a heavy
blast that fairly made the island tremble. The
lightning had died away somewhat, but now and
then would come a great flash, followed by a
crash and rumble that would echo and reëcho
among the rocks.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Just look at the ocean!” cried Dave, as he
and his chums walked to one corner of the entrance
to gaze out.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“The waves seem to be mountain-high,” returned
Phil. “You wouldn’t think it possible a
ship could live on such a sea.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Well, it is mighty dangerous, Phil; you know
that as well as I do.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I hope the <em>Golden Eagle</em> weathers the
storm.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“We all hope that.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Dinner was a rather scanty meal, cooked with
great difficulty in a hollow of the rocks. The
smoke from the fire rolled and swirled in all directions,
nearly blinding everybody. But the repast
was better than nothing, and nobody grumbled.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
By nightfall the rain ceased. But the wind was
almost as strong as ever, and when those in the
cave ventured outside they had to be on guard,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214'></a>214</span>
for fear a flying tree-branch would come down on
their heads.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Captain Sanders was much worried over the
safety of his vessel, but he did not let on to the
boys, since it would have done no good. But the
lads understood, and they, too, were more or less
alarmed, remembering the fate that had overtaken
the <em>Emma Brower</em> in a storm that had been no
worse than the present one.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
With so much rain driving in, the cave was a
damp place, and the boys were glad enough to go
outside. They looked for wood that might be
easily dried, and after much difficulty, succeeded
in starting up a new campfire, around which the
whole crowd gathered.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I’m goin’ to try my luck along shore,” said
Billy Dill, and started off with Dave, Phil, and
Roger, to see if any fish or turtles could be located.
They found the shore strewn with wreckage.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh, Billy, can this be from our ship?” exclaimed
Phil, in alarm.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I don’t think so, lad. Looks to me like it
had been in the water some days. I reckon it’s
from the <em>Emma Brower</em>, or some other craft.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
In the wreckage they found the remains of several
boxes and barrels. But the contents had become
water-soaked or had sunk to the bottom of
the sea; so there was nothing in the shape of food
for them. They also came across the mainmast of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215'></a>215</span>
bark, with some of the stays still
dragging around it.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“That will do for a pole, in case we wish
to hoist a flag,” suggested the senator’s son.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
They found neither fish nor turtles, and at last
had to return to the campfire disappointed. There
was next to nothing to eat for supper.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Well, better luck in the morning,” said Captain
Sanders, with an air of cheerfulness he did
not feel. “As soon as this wind dies down our
ship will come back, and then we’ll have all we
want to eat.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
It was a long, dreary night that followed, and
the boys were glad to behold the sun come up
brightly in the morning. Dave was the first up,
but his chums quickly followed, and all went down
to the beach, to look for fish and also to see if the
<em>Golden Eagle</em> was anywhere in sight.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
This time they had better luck, so far as food
was concerned. In a hollow they found over a
score of fish that had been cast from the ocean
by the breakers, and they also found a fine turtle
that was pinned down by a fallen tree.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“That’s a new way to catch a turtle,” remarked
Dave. “It’s a regular trap.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Turtle soup, yum! yum!” murmured Phil.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“And broiled fish,—all you want, too!” added
Roger, smacking his lips.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
When they got back to the camp they found that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216'></a>216</span>
the fire had been renewed, and soon the appetizing
odor of broiling fish filled the air. Then Captain
Sanders and one of the castaway sailors came in
from a walk in another direction, carrying an airtight
canister, which, on being opened, was found
to contain fancy crackers.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“There is a good deal of wreckage down on the
beach,” said the captain. “We’ll inspect it after
breakfast.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Having eaten their fill of the fish and the
crackers, and leaving Billy Dill and some of the
others busy making turtle soup, the boys and Captain
Sanders took another walk along the beach,
to look over the wreckage and also see if they
could sight the <em>Golden Eagle</em>, or locate Jasniff
or Merwell.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I hope we can find those two fellows,” said
Dave. “I can stand this suspense no longer. I
must know what has become of those jewels!”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217'></a>217</span><a name='chXXIII' id='chXXIII'></a>CHAPTER XXIII—A STRANGE DISCOVERY</h2>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
A half-mile was covered when, on turning a
point of rocks, the boys and the captain came to
a sandy cove. Here was more of the wreckage,
and the whole party ran down to the beach to
investigate.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Boxes, barrels, and bits of timber were strewn
from one end of the cove to the other, and in the
mass were a number of things of more or less
value—timber, food, and some clothing. There
was also a trunk, but it was open and empty.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Look!” cried Dave, suddenly, and pointed to
a small, black leather case, that rested on some of
the wreckage.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“What is it?” queried Phil and Roger, in a
breath.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Dave did not reply, for he was crawling over
the wreckage with care. Soon he reached the spot
where the black leather case rested, caught on a
nail, and he picked it up. The clasp was undone
and the case fell open, revealing the interior, which
was lined with white plush.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Empty!” murmured Dave, sadly. “Empty!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218'></a>218</span>
There was a groan in his voice as he uttered
the word.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“What is it, Dave?” asked the senator’s son,
although he and Phil guessed the truth.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“It’s the Carwith jewel-case,” was the answer.
“The very case that Mr. Carwith left with Mr.
Wadsworth!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Are you certain?” demanded Phil.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Yes, for here is the name, ‘Ridgewood Osgood
Carwith,’ stamped in gold on the top.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“And empty,” murmured the captain. “This
looks bad,” and he shook his head, thoughtfully.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Maybe Jasniff and Merwell took the jewels
from the case,” suggested Roger, hopefully.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“It is possible, Roger. But—but—I am afraid
the jewels are at the bottom of the ocean,” answered
Dave, and his face showed how downcast
he felt.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“They might have taken the jewels and divided
them between themselves,” said Phil. “Maybe
they put them in money-belts, or something like
that. They might think that the sailors would
rob them, if they saw the case.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“It’s possible, Phil, and I hope you are right,”
answered our hero. But in his heart he was still
afraid that the gems had gone to the bottom of
the Atlantic.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I think we had better climb to the top of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219'></a>219</span>
yonder rise and take a look around the island,”
said the captain. “For all we know, the <em>Golden
Eagle</em> may be on the other side. I sincerely hope
she has weathered the storm.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Placing the jewel-case in a safe place between
the rocks, the party commenced to climb the rise
of ground the captain had pointed out. This was
no easy task, since the rocks were rough and
there were many openings, leading to the caves
below.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“We don’t want another tumble,” remarked
Roger to Dave.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Hardly, Roger; once was enough.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
The sun had come out strongly, consequently
the water was drying away rapidly. It was very
warm, and the boys were glad that they had
donned thin clothing on leaving the ship.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
At last they reached the top of the rise and
from that elevation were able to see all but the
southern end of Cave Island, which was hidden by
a growth of palms.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Not a ship of any kind was in sight, much to
the captain’s disappointment.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Must have had to sail away a good many
miles,” said Dave.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Either that, lad, or else the storm caused
more or less trouble.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
From the elevation, all took a good look at
every part of the island that could be seen. They
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220'></a>220</span>
saw several other rocky elevations and the entrances
to caves innumerable.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Tell you one thing,” remarked Phil. “If
there was any truth in that story of a pirates’
treasure, the pirates would have plenty of places
where to hide the hoard.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Humph! I don’t believe in the treasure and
never will,” returned Roger. “If the treasure
was ever here, you can make up your mind that
somebody got hold of it long before this.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“If those Englishmen came here, it is queer
that we don’t see some trace of them,” said Captain
Sanders.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Maybe they are like Jasniff and Merwell,
keeping out of sight,” ventured Dave.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“That may be true.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I think I see some figures moving down near
the shore over there,” continued Roger, after another
look around. “But they are so far off I
am not sure. They may be animals.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“They look like two men to me,” exclaimed
Dave, after a long look. “What if they should
be Jasniff and Merwell! Oh, let us walk there
and make sure!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“That’s a good, stiff walk,” answered Captain
Sanders. “We can’t go from here very well—unless
we want to climb over some rough rocks.
It would be better to go down and follow the
shore.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221'></a>221</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Then let us do that. It won’t do us any good
to go back to where we left the others, now the
ship isn’t in sight.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
But the captain demurred, and finally it was
agreed to return to camp and start out for the
other side of the island directly after dinner.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Turtle soup for all hands!” announced Billy
Dill, proudly. “Best ever made, too.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“It certainly smells good,” answered Dave.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
The turtle soup proved both palatable and
nourishing, and, eaten with crackers, made a good
meal.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“We’ll take some crackers and fish along,”
said the captain, to the boys, when they were preparing
to leave the camp again. “For there is
no telling how soon we’ll get back. It may take
us longer than we think to reach the other side
of this island.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I’ve got a knapsack,” said one of the castaway
sailors. “You can take that along, filled,”
and so it was arranged. Dave carried his gun
and the captain had a pistol.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“If there is any game, we’ll have a try for it,”
said Dave. “Even a few plump birds would make
fine eating.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Yes, or a rabbit or hare,” added Roger.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
The party walked along the shore as far as they
could go and then, coming to what appeared to
be an old trail, took to that.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222'></a>222</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“What do you make of this path?” said Dave.
“I had an idea the island was uninhabited.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“It is supposed to be,” answered Captain Sanders.
“But there is no reason why somebody
shouldn’t live here.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Presently they came to a fine spring of water.
Near by lay an old rusty cup, and a little further
on a broken bucket.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Somebody has been here and that recently,”
was Dave’s comment. “I hope we are on the trail
of Merwell and Jasniff.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
They walked on a little further and then, of a
sudden, Captain Sanders halted the boys and
pointed up into one of the trees.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Wild pigeons!” exclaimed Dave. “And
hundreds of them! Shall I give them a couple of
barrels, captain?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Might as well, lad. Wild pigeons are good
eating, especially when you are hungry. Get as
many of ’em as you can.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Dave approached a little closer and took aim
with care. Bang! went the shotgun, and a wild
fluttering and flying followed. Bang! went the
second barrel of the weapon, and then, as the
smoke cleared away, the boys and the captain saw
seven of the pigeons come down to the ground.
Several others fluttered around and Phil caught
one and wrung its neck, and Roger laid another
low with a stick he had picked up.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223'></a>223</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Fine shots, both of them,” declared Captain
Sanders. “Now load up again, Dave, so as to be
ready for anything else that shows up.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I am afraid I have scared the rest of the
game,” declared our hero, and so it proved, for
after that they saw nothing but some small birds.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
They passed through a thick woods and then
came rather unexpectedly to a wall of rocks, all of
a hundred feet in height. At the base of the
wall was an opening leading into a broad cave.
Near the entrance was the remains of a campfire.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Somebody has been here and that recently!”
cried Phil, as he examined the embers.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Must be Merwell and Jasniff!” cried Dave.
“For if they were strangers they would come out
and see what the shooting meant.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Shall we go into the cave, or continue on the
way to the shore?” questioned the senator’s son.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh, let us take a peep into the cave first,”
cried Phil. “It looks as if it was inhabited.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
The others were willing, and lighting a firebrand
that was handy, they entered the cavern.
In front they found the opening to be broad and
low, but in the rear the ceiling was much higher
and there were several passageways leading in as
many different directions.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“What an island!” murmured Roger. “Why,
one could spend a year in visiting all the caves!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224'></a>224</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“It’s like a great, big sponge!” returned Phil.
“Holes everywhere!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Take care that you don’t slip down into some
opening!” warned Captain Sanders.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
In one of the passages they came across the remains
of a meal and also some empty bottles.
Then Dave saw some bits of paper strewn over
the rocky floor.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“What are they, Phil?” he asked, and then
both commenced to pick the pieces up. Roger
helped, while the captain held the firebrand.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Well, of all things!” cried the shipowner’s
son. “Now what do you make of this?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“The chart!” cried Dave.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Yes!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“What chart?” queried the master of the
<em>Golden Eagle</em>.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“The treasure chart those four Englishmen
had,” answered Dave. “Now what made them
come here with it and tear it to pieces?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Hum!” mused the captain. “One of two
things would make ’em do that, lad. Either they
got the treasure and had no further use for the
map, or else they found the whole thing was a
fake and in their rage they tore the map to
shreds.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“They must have gotten the gold!” murmured
Roger and Phil.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“No, I think they got fooled,” said Dave.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225'></a>225</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“The question is, if those Britishers were here,
where did they go to?” asked the captain.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Let us call,” suggested Dave. “They may
be in some part of this cave where they couldn’t
hear the shots from my gun.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
All called out several times, and listened intently
for a reply.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Hark! I hear something!” cried Roger.
“Listen!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
They strained their ears, and from what appeared
to be a great distance they heard a human
voice. But what was said they could not make
out.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Too many echoes here,” declared the captain.
“A fellow can’t tell where the cry comes from.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Well, let us investigate,” said our hero.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
They moved forward and backward, up one
passageway and down another, calling and listening.
At times the voice seemed to be quite close,
then it sounded further off than ever.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“This sure is a mystery!” declared Phil.
“What do you make of it, Dave?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I am beginning to think the call came from
somewhere overhead,” answered our hero. “Captain,
see if you can flash a light on those rocks to
the left of our heads.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Captain Sanders did as requested, and presently
all in the party saw another passageway, leading
up from a series of rocks that formed something
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226'></a>226</span>
of a natural stairway. Up this they went, Dave
leading the van. Then they came to a small opening
between two rocks.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Help! help!” came in a half-smothered voice.
“Help, please. Don’t leave me here in the dark
any longer!”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227'></a>227</span><a name='chXXIV' id='chXXIV'></a>CHAPTER XXIV—JASNIFF AND MERWELL</h2>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“It’s a man!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“One of the Englishmen!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“You are right, lads,” came from Captain
Sanders. “And see, he is bound hands and feet
to the rocks!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
What the master of the <em>Golden Eagle</em> said was
true, and as the firebrand was flashed on the scene,
the chums could do little but stare in astonishment.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Lying on his back between the rocks was the
Englishman named Giles Borden. Hands and
feet were bound with a strong cord, which ran
around a projection of the rocks in such a manner
that the prisoner could scarcely move.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Who tied you up?” questioned Dave, as he
and Phil set to work to liberate the prisoner.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Geswick, Pardell, and Rumney,” groaned the
prisoner. “Oh, if only I had my hands on them!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Why did they do it?” asked Captain Sanders.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“They wanted to rob me—and they did rob
me!” answered Giles Borden. “Oh, help me
out of this wretched hole and give me a drink of
water! I am dying from thirst!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228'></a>228</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Not without difficulty the man was freed of the
rope and helped to get out from between the rocks.
Then Dave and Roger half carried him down to
the cave proper. The crowd had a canteen of
water and the man drank, eagerly.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“So your friends robbed you?” said Captain
Sanders, curiously.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Do not call them friends of mine!” returned
Giles Borden. “They are not friends—they are
vipers, wolves! Oh, if ever I meet them again at
home I’ll soon have them in prison, or know the
reason why!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Hadn’t you better tell us all about it?” went
on the master of the <em>Golden Eagle</em>.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Wait a minute!” cried Dave. “Do you suppose
those men are anywhere near here?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I don’t know. They said they would be back,
but they did not come.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“They may have seen us and skipped out,”
ventured the senator’s son.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“More than likely,” groaned Giles Borden.
“Now that they have my money they won’t want
to stay here. They’ll take passage on that ship as
soon as she comes in and leave me to shift for
myself.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Tell us your story, so we can understand what
you are talking about,” said Captain Sanders.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
In a disconnected manner the Englishman related
his tale, pausing occasionally to take another
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229'></a>229</span>
drink of water. He said he was from London
and had met Geswick, Pardell, and Rumney less
than six months before. They had come to him
with the story of a wonderful pirates’ treasure
said to be hidden on Cave Island, and had asked
him to finance an expedition in search of it.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I had just fallen heir to five thousand pounds
through the death of my father,” he went on, “and
I was anxious to get the treasure, so I consented
to pay the expenses of the trip, taking the three
men along. They had the chart that you saw on
shipboard and some other particulars, and they
made me bring along a thousand pounds extra,
stating that we might have to pay some natives
well to get them to show us where the particular
cave we were seeking was located.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Then had followed the trip to Florida and the
one to Barbados. At the latter island a schooner
had been chartered to take them to Cave Island,
where they were landed on the eastern shore. The
schooner was to come back for the Englishmen a
week later.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“As soon as the treasure hunt began I suspected
that I was being hoaxed,” continued Giles Borden.
“For all I knew, we were alone on the island.
We found several huts, but they were all deserted.
We visited a score of caves, but saw nothing that
looked like a treasure. Then, one afternoon, Geswick
asked me about the extra thousand pounds
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230'></a>230</span>
I was carrying. I grew suspicious and tried to
hide the money between the rocks. The three
caught me at it and pounced on the money like a
pack of wolves. Then, when I remonstrated, they
laughed at me, and told me to keep quiet, that
they were going to run matters to suit themselves.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“They must have intended to rob you from the
start,” said Dave.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“You are right, and I was a fool to trust them.
As soon as they had my money, one of them,
Rumney, tore up the chart and threw the pieces
in my face. That angered me so greatly that I
struck him with my fist, knocking him down. Then
the three leaped on me and made me a prisoner,
binding me with the rope. I tried my best to get
away, but could not. That was at night. In the
morning they went off, saying they would come
back later and give me something to eat. But
that is the last I have seen or heard of them.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“If we hadn’t found you, you might have
starved to death,” murmured Captain Sanders.
“They ought to be punished heavily for this—and
for robbing you!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
The Englishman was glad enough to get something
to eat, and then said he felt much stronger.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“But what brings you to this island?” he questioned,
while partaking of the food.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“We are after a pair of criminals,” answered
Dave, as the others looked at him, not knowing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231'></a>231</span>
what to say. “Two young fellows who ran away
with some valuable jewels. I suppose you saw
nothing of them.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“No, as I said before, we saw nobody.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“They are on this island.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Then I hope you catch them. And I hope
you’ll aid me in catching those other scamps.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“We’ll certainly do that,” answered Captain
Sanders.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
A little later the whole party left the cave, and
Giles Borden pointed out a number of other caves
he had visited.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“The island is full of them,” declared the
Englishman. “And one has to be careful, for fear
of falling into a hole at every step.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
The middle of the afternoon found the party
once more at the water’s edge. They had seen
no trace of Jasniff and Merwell, or of the rascally
Englishmen. All were tired out and content to
rest for a little while.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Looks like a wild goose chase, doesn’t it,
Dave?” remarked Roger.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh, you mustn’t grow discouraged so quickly,
Roger,” was Dave’s answer. “Unless Jasniff and
Merwell have a chance to leave this island we’ll
be sure to locate them, sooner or later. What I
am worried about mostly is the question: Have
they the jewels or did the gems go to the bottom
of the ocean?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232'></a>232</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Yes, that’s the most important question of all.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“It will be poor consolation to catch Jasniff
and Merwell and not get the jewels,” put in Phil.
“I reckon, Dave, you’d rather have it the other
way around—get the jewels and miss Jasniff and
Merwell.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Indeed, yes, Phil.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“In case we don’t——” began the senator’s son,
and then stopped short. He had seen Captain
Sanders leap up and start inland.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“What did you see, Captain?” asked Dave.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I saw somebody looking at us, from behind
yonder trees!” cried the master of the <em>Golden
Eagle</em>.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“One of the Englishmen?” queried Phil.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“No, it was somebody younger—looked a little
like that picture of Link Merwell!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Come on—after them!” cried Dave, and
started on a run in the direction the captain indicated.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
All were soon on the way, climbing over some
rough rocks at first and then crashing through
the heavy undergrowth. Then they entered a forest
of tropical trees and vines.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I see them!” exclaimed Dave, after several
hundred feet had been covered. “Jasniff and
Merwell as sure as you live! Stop! Stop, I tell
you!” he called out.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“You keep back, Dave Porter!” yelled Nick
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233'></a>233</span>
Jasniff in return. “Keep back, or it will be the
worse for you!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Jasniff, you had better surrender!” cried
Roger.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“We’ll be sure to get you sooner or later!”
added Phil.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“You’ll never catch me!” answered the other.
“Now keep back, or maybe somebody will get
shot.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Do you think he’ll shoot?” asked Captain
Sanders, in some alarm, while Giles Borden stopped
short.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Possibly,” answered Dave. “But I am going
after him anyway,” he added sturdily. “I came
here to catch those rascals and I am going to do
it.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“And I am with you,” said Phil, promptly.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Scare ’em with your gun, Dave,” suggested
the senator’s son.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I will,” was our hero’s reply, and he brought
the weapon to the front. “I’ve got a gun, Jasniff!”
he called out. “You had better stop!
And you had better stop too, Merwell!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Don’t yo-you shoot at us!” screamed Link
Merwell, in sudden terror. And then he ran with
all speed for the nearest trees and dove out of
sight. The next instant Jasniff disappeared, likewise.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Dave was now thoroughly aroused, and he resolved to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234'></a>234</span>
do his best to run the rascals down and
corner them. Shifting his shotgun once more to
his back, he ran on in the direction the pair had
taken, and Roger, Phil, and the captain and the
Englishman followed.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Listening occasionally, they could hear Jasniff
and Merwell crashing through the undergrowth
and at the same time calling to each other. Evidently
they had become separated and were trying
to get together again.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
As they advanced into the forest, Dave caught
sight of Merwell. He was behind a low fringe
of bushes and an instant later disappeared.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Stop, Merwell!” he called out. “It won’t
do you any good to run. We are bound to catch
you, sooner or later.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Yo-you let me alone, Dave Porter!” spluttered
Merwell. He was almost out of breath, so
violent had been his exertions.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Dave kept on and soon reached the low bushes.
Then he saw Merwell again, this time leaping for
some brushwood between two tall rocks.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I’ve got you now!” he said, sharply. “You
may as well give in!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh, Porter, please let me——” commenced
Link Merwell, and then Dave’s hand caught him
by the shoulder and whirled him about.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
As this happened something else occurred that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235'></a>235</span>
filled both pursued and pursuer with alarm. The
grass and brushwood under their feet began to give
way. Then of a sudden Link Merwell sank from
sight, and Dave disappeared after him!
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
In the meanwhile Phil and the others kept on in
the direction Nick Jasniff had taken. Twice they
caught sight of the former bully of Oak Hall, but
each time he was further away than before.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“You’ll not catch me!” cried Jasniff. “You
might as well give up trying.” Then he dove into
another section of the forest and they saw no
more of him.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“What has become of Dave?” asked Phil,
when he and Roger came together, a little
later.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I thought he was with you, Phil.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“And I thought he was with you.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“He went after that other chap,” put in Captain
Sanders. “Perhaps he caught him. They
were over in that direction,” and the captain
pointed with his hand.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
All proceeded in the direction indicated. But
they did not catch sight of either Dave or Merwell.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Well, this is strange, to say the least,” remarked
Phil, after they had called out several
times. “What do you make of it, Roger?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I’m sure I don’t know, Phil. They can’t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236'></a>236</span>
have gotten so far away but what they could hear
us call.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Maybe they fell into one of the caves,” suggested
Captain Sanders.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“If they have, we had better hunt for Dave at
once,” returned Roger.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237'></a>237</span><a name='chXXV' id='chXXV'></a>CHAPTER XXV—LINK MERWELL’S STORY</h2>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Down and down and still down went Dave,
with Link Merwell in front of him. Daylight
was left behind with a suddenness that was appalling.
The brushwood scratched our hero’s
face and he could not repress a cry of alarm.
Merwell screamed loud and long and an echo
came back that was weird and ghostlike. Then
came a mighty splash, and both boys went into
the water over their heads.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Dave was a good swimmer, and as soon as he
entered the water he struck out to save himself.
He came up in almost utter darkness, so he had
to go it blindly, not knowing in what direction to
turn. Then he heard a wild spluttering and knew
the sounds came from his enemy.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Merwell!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh, Porter! Sa-save me, please!” gasped
Link Merwell.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Why don’t you swim?—that is what I am
doing.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I—I—struck my head on a rock! Oh, save
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238'></a>238</span>
me!” And then came a gasp, and the scamp disappeared
under the surface.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Dave was close by and knew the direction by
the noise. Taking a few strokes, he bumped into
Merwell, who promptly tried to catch his would-be
rescuer by the throat. But our hero was on
guard and turned him around.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Keep quiet, or I’ll let go!” he ordered, as he
began to tread water. As Merwell obeyed, Dave
struck out to where he saw a faint streak of light.
He made out a shelving rock, and after some difficulty,
reached this. Here the water was only up
to his waist, and he waded along, half carrying
his enemy, until they reached another series of
rocks, where both crawled up to a spot that was
dry. From somewhere overhead came a faint
streak of light, testifying to the fact that there was
an opening beyond, even if it could not be
seen.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh, my head!” murmured Link Merwell,
and put up one hand to a lump that was rising on
his forehead.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I got struck myself,” said Dave. “But it
didn’t amount to much. I told you to stop. If
you had done so, we wouldn’t have gotten into this
pickle.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Whe-where are we?” asked Merwell, and
there was a shiver in his tone.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Down at the bottom of that hole.” Dave
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239'></a>239</span>
tried to pierce the darkness. “Looks like some
underground river to me.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“The water is salt.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Then this place must connect with the ocean.”
Dave drew a deep breath. “Merwell, tell me
truthfully, what did you do with those jewels?”
he questioned, eagerly. Even in that time of peril
he could not forget the mission that had brought
him to Cave Island.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Who—who said I had the jewels?” faltered
the other.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I know you and Jasniff took them—it is useless
for you to deny it.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“How do you know that?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Never mind now. Answer my question.
Have you the jewels, or did you give them to
Jasniff?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I didn’t give Nick anything.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Then you have them.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“How do you know?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I am not here to answer questions, Link Merwell.
I want to know what you did with the
jewels.” Dave’s voice grew stern. “Answer me
at once!” And he caught Merwell by the arm.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Don’t—don’t shove me into the water!”
cried the scamp, in alarm, although Dave had no
intention of doing as he imagined. “I—I—we—er—we
divided the jewels between us. But Nick
got the best of them.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240'></a>240</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“And what did you do with your share?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I’ll—er—I’ll tell you when we get out of this
hole.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“You’ll tell me right now, Merwell!” And
again Dave caught the culprit by the arm.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I—I put my share of the jewels in my money-belt,”
he faltered.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Have you it on now?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Yes. But Nick has the best of the jewels—I
got only the little ones,” went on Link Merwell,
half-angrily. It was easy to surmise that he and
Jasniff had not gotten along well together.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“How is it Jasniff got the best of them?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“He had the jewel-case when we were about
to leave the bark during the storm. Everybody
was excited, and he said we couldn’t carry the case—that
it wouldn’t be safe, for we might drop it
and all of the jewels would be lost. He said we
had better divide them and put them in our belts.
We had bought belts for that purpose in Jacksonville.
So we took the jewels out of the case and
threw the box away. I thought I had my share,
but after we got to this island, and I had a chance
to look, I saw he had the lion’s share, about three-quarters,
in fact, and all the big ones.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“And he has them now?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Yes,—that is, he did have them just before
we saw you.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Did you sell or pawn any of the jewels?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241'></a>241</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Only a few small ones. We were afraid to
offer the big ones, so soon after the—well, you
know,” and Link Merwell stopped short, looking
everything but happy.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“You mean so soon after the robbery,” said
Dave, bluntly.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Yes.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Link, whatever—but never mind that now,”
continued our hero, hastily. “Hand over the
money-belt.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“What, now?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Yes, at once. I’ll not trust you to carry those
jewels a minute longer.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Can’t you wait till we get out of this wretched
hole?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I might, but I am not going to. Hand it over
and be careful that none of the jewels are
lost. Your father may have to pay for the
others.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
With fingers that trembled from fear and chilliness,
Link Merwell slipped his hands under the
light clothing he wore and took off the money-belt
that encircled his waist.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“There is some money there that belongs to
me,” he began, hesitatingly.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“You’ll get back what is yours, never fear,”
answered Dave, and took the belt. He saw to it
that it was tightly closed, then fastened it around
his own waist.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242'></a>242</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Remember, Nick has the best of the jewels,”
went on Merwell, rather spitefully.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I am not likely to forget it,” answered Dave,
grimly. “Now, the sooner we get out of this
hole the better.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Merwell was just as anxious to see daylight,
even if he was to be held a prisoner, and together
the boys hunted around for some exit from the
underground watercourse. But the only way out
seemed to be far overhead, and to climb up the
smooth, sloping rocks proved impossible.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh, what shall we do?” groaned Merwell,
after they had attempted to climb up and
had failed. “We are caught like rats in a
trap!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Perhaps we’ll have to swim for it,” answered
Dave. “This water is very salt, which proves
it comes from the ocean. Moreover, it is gradually
going down, showing it is affected by the
tide. Let us follow the stream for a short distance
and see where it leads to.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Merwell demurred, but he did not want to remain
behind alone in the semi-darkness, so he
followed Dave, and both waded and swam a
distance of several hundred feet. Here the underground
river made a turn around the rocks, and
both boys were delighted to see a streak of sunlight
resting on the water.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“An opening of some sort!” cried our hero.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243'></a>243</span>
“Come on!” And he swam on boldly and Merwell
followed as quickly as he could.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Soon the pair reached a break in the cave. On
either side were walls of rocks, uneven and covered
with scanty bushes and immense trailing vines.
The opening was about a hundred feet in length,
and beyond it the stream of salty water plunged
into another cavern, undoubtedly on its way to
the ocean.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Well, we are out of the cave in one way but
not in another,” observed Dave, as he stood on
the dry rocks and gazed about. “It’s going to
be a stiff climb to get out of here.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Ca-can’t you wait till I—I get my breath,”
panted Merwell.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Yes, for I want to get my own breath back.
Perhaps we’ll have to go through that next cave
to get out,” he continued, after a pause.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh, I hope not! I hate it underground!”
And Merwell shivered. “Besides, it’s cold,” he
went on, to cover up the tremor in his
voice.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Yes, it is cold,” returned Dave, shortly.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
He sat down to rest, and Merwell followed suit.
On all sides were the rocky walls and trailing
vines, while at their feet ran the silent, mysterious
stream of salty water.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Dave looked at the walls and the stream, and
then looked at Merwell. The face of the other
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244'></a>244</span>
youth was a study. He was downcast to the last
degree.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Link, what made you do it?” he asked, in
a voice that was not unkindly.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I didn’t do it—that is, it wasn’t my plan!”
burst out the culprit, passionately. “Oh, I know
they’ll hold me for it, just the same as they’ll
hold Nick, if they catch him! But I’ll tell you
honestly, Dave, it wasn’t any of my planning.
I’m bad, and I know it, but I am not as bad as
that. It was Nick who got the whole thing up.
You know how mad he has been at you ever since
he had to leave Oak Hall. Well, it was his plan
to make you a prisoner first and then make it look
as if you had robbed the jewelry works. You ask
Doctor Montgomery if that isn’t so. Well, the
first part of the plan fell through, for you got
away. Then he got me to go to Crumville, and
found out where we could get the dynamite. I
got scared then and wanted to back out, but he
said if I did he’d throw all the blame on me, and
so I stuck to him. I wish I hadn’t done it,” concluded
Merwell, bitterly.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Did you go direct to Jacksonville after the
robbery?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“No, we went to Washington first and there
we pawned one diamond for sixty dollars. Then
we went to Jacksonville. There we met Luke
Watson, and both of us got scared to death. We
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245'></a>245</span>
had paid for our passage on the <em>Emma Brower</em>,
and we kept out of sight till the bark sailed.
After the storm we landed here with those four
sailors, and were waiting to sight some passing
ship when you and your crowd turned up.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“What were you going to do at Barbados?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Keep quiet until this affair blew over and then
take some English vessel for England. There,
Jasniff said, he could get a certain pawnbroker to
take the jewels and give us a good price for them.
You’ll remember, he was in England some time.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Yes, I met him there. But, Link, didn’t you
realize what a crime you were committing?” went
on Dave, earnestly.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I did—after it was too late. Many a time
I wanted to back out, but Nick wouldn’t let me.
We had a quarrel in Washington, and another in
Jacksonville, and on the ship I came close to exposing
him to the captain. I think I should have
done it, only the hurricane came up, and then we
had to hustle to save our lives.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
A silence followed, for each of the boys was
busy with his thoughts. Dave felt sorry for his
former schoolmate, but he knew Merwell thoroughly,
and knew that the fellow was more sorry
because he was caught than because he had committed
a great wrong. He belonged to the class
of persons who are willing to repent when it is
too late.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246'></a>246</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
The day was drawing to a close, and already the
sunlight had disappeared beyond the high rocks.
With a deep sigh Dave arose to his feet and
stretched himself, and Merwell followed suit.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“What are you going to do?” asked the former
bully of Oak Hall.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I am going to try to climb up those rocks.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“They are terribly steep!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I know it, but those vines look strong and we
can use them as ropes, Link. But you need not
try it, if you don’t want to.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh, if you try, so will I, Dave.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
After that but little was said, both lads saving
their breath for the task before them. Dave went
up first, testing each vine with care as he advanced.
Twice he slipped back, and once Merwell
came to his aid and held him. It was a little
thing to do, but it pleased our hero, and his face
showed it.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
At last they were out of the hollow and each
threw himself on the ground to rest. Then Dave
walked to a near-by hill and gazed in every direction.
Not a human being was in sight anywhere.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Well, we’ve got to find them somehow,” he
said to Merwell. “Come ahead.” And side by
side they set off through the forest in the fast-gathering
darkness.

<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Well, we are lost, that is all there is to it.
And I am so dead tired I can’t walk another step.”
And thus speaking, Link Merwell sank down on
a tree-root to rest.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
He and Dave had been plunging along through
the forest and across several clearings for the
larger part of an hour. They had found what
looked to be a trail, but it had suddenly come to
an end in front of a small cave that looked to be
the lair of some wild animal, and they had gone
on once more. Now the darkness of the tropics
shut out the surrounding landscape.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Link Merwell certainly looked the picture of
misery. His clothing was much tattered and still
wet, and his forehead was swollen from contact
with the rocks. One of his shoes was so cut that
his bare foot was exposed.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“It looks as if we were lost,” replied Dave.
“In this darkness it will be difficult to go much
further. But I had hoped, by keeping in a
straight line, that, sooner or later, we’d reach the
shore of the island.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248'></a>248</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I reckon we didn’t walk in a straight line—most
folks that get lost in a woods don’t.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“You are right in that, but I kept as straight as
I could, Link. However, that is neither here nor
there. If we have got to stay here all night we
may as well try to make ourselves comfortable.
But I wish the others knew I was safe.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Can’t you fire your gun? It ought to be dry
by now.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I’ll try it.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Dave sat down and commenced to work over
the fowling-piece. In a few minutes he tried it.
Bang! went the gun, the shot echoing far and wide
through the forest and among the rocks. Then
both boys listened for a reply.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Nothing doing,” muttered Merwell, after a
minute of utter silence.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I am sure the others would fire a shot in return
if they heard that,” said Dave. “We must
be further from them than I expected. Well, I
don’t see what we can do excepting to try to make
ourselves comfortable. We might climb one of
these tall palms and take a look around.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Yes, that’s it!” exclaimed the other youth,
eagerly. “Why didn’t we think of that before?
But it will be hard work climbing one of those
trees,” went on Merwell, gazing up at the straight
trunk with the first of the limbs many feet above
their heads.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249'></a>249</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I’ll do it native fashion,” answered Dave.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
He had seen the natives of the South Sea Islands
climb tall trees by means of a vine-rope cast about
the waist and the tree-trunk. Selecting several
strong vines, he twisted them into a rope, and then
passed the same around a tree-trunk and to the
back of his waist. Then he took off his shoes and
stockings and placed his bare feet against the tree.
By “hiking” the rope a few inches at a time, he
was able to “walk up the tree” with comparative
ease.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
As soon as the branches were reached, Dave
discarded the rope and went up as far as the
strength of the tree would permit. He was now
close enough to the top to get a good look around,
and he cast his eyes about eagerly, hoping to catch
sight of some of his friends, or their campfire.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“See anything?” called up Merwell, eagerly.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Not yet,” answered Dave, and then he turned
around in the tree-top. He now made out the rolling
sea.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I see a light!” he cried.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“A campfire?” queried the youth below.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“No, it is on the water. I think it must be a
light on a ship.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“What kind of a ship?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“A sailing vessel of some sort,” answered Dave,
and he wondered if it could be the <em>Golden Eagle</em>,
coming back after the storm.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250'></a>250</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Maybe it’s the ship that was coming back for
those Englishmen,” went on Merwell, for Dave
had told him about the men. He heaved a mountainous
sigh as he realized how affairs had turned
against him. For a moment he thought of running
away and trying to find Jasniff, but then the
darkness and loneliness of the forest appalled him.
He felt that he would rather be a prisoner than
be alone in such a spot.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Dave watched the waving light for some time,
as it rose and fell on the bosom of the ocean,
but could learn nothing concerning the craft that
showed it. Then he continued to look around the
island. No campfire was to be located, and finally
he rejoined Merwell.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“The light on that ship was all I saw,” he said.
“Perhaps it might pay to walk down to the shore
in that direction. But it is a long distance, and
in the darkness we might fall into another of the
caves.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Let us stay here,” answered Merwell.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“It will probably be as well. We can build
a campfire and dry our clothing and then go to
bed.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Wish I had something to eat,” grumbled the
lad who had been caught.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“So do I, Link. But we haven’t anything, so
we’ll have to make the best of it. Try to find
some firewood. Luckily I have a waterproof
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251'></a>251</span>
matchsafe along and it is full of matches,” added
our hero.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Fate was kinder to them than they had expected,
for in hunting for firewood, Merwell found
a hole containing what they took to be native
hares. He killed two of the creatures, and at
once set to work to clean and skin them. Then,
when Dave had started the fire, the game
was broiled while the boys had their clothing
drying.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Not much of a meal, but better than nothing,”
said Merwell, and our hero agreed with him.
They found some water in a hollow of the rocks,
left there by the hurricane, and had a drink, after
which both lay down to rest.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Don’t you think we ought to stand guard?”
asked the big youth.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh, I don’t know,” replied Dave. “I am
dead tired and so are you, and I don’t think anybody
will come to harm us,—and there are no
large wild beasts on the island. I guess we can
take a chance,” and as soon as their clothing was
dry, both turned in, on beds of vines and moss.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
In the morning Merwell was the first to stir,
and when Dave awoke he found the campfire
burning merrily. The big youth was nowhere
to be seen.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Can he have run away?” mused our hero, and
quickly felt to learn if the money-belt with the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252'></a>252</span>
jewels was safe. It was still in its place and he
breathed a sigh of relief. Then he gave a call.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Coming!” came from a distance, and in a
few minutes Merwell put in an appearance, bringing
with him some berries and fruits.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“One of those sailors who came ashore with
me told me about these,” he said. “The berries
we can eat raw and they are very good. The fruit
we can slice up and toast. They make a pretty
decent meal,” and so it proved, and both youths
ate their fill. Then Dave announced his intention
of climbing the tree again and having another look
around.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“That ship is at the south end of the island,”
he announced. “It is not the <em>Golden Eagle</em>, but a
much smaller craft. Most likely it is the vessel
the Englishmen engaged. If it is, those three
rascals will have a chance to get away before Giles
Borden can catch them and make them give up
the money they took from him.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh, Dave, do you think——” And then
Merwell stopped short.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“What were you going to say, Link?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I was thinking if it would be possible for
Nick to go away with those Englishmen.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Why, yes, if he chanced to meet them, and
they were willing to have him. But would he go
and leave you behind?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“He might, especially if he found out I was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253'></a>253</span>
captured, or that I had let you have what jewels
I was carrying.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“If he went with those Englishmen he would
be foolish to let them know about the jewels, for
they would rob him, just as they robbed Giles
Borden,” continued our hero, and then he realized
that here was a new peril to face. If the Englishmen
got their hands on the jewels it might be
next to impossible to recover the gems, especially
if the rascals managed to get away from Cave
Island.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Presently our hero saw a column of smoke arising
in another portion of the island. He watched
it for several minutes and then gave a cry of
satisfaction.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I know where they are!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“You mean your crowd?” queried Merwell.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Yes. Phil is signaling to me, by means of
a column of smoke such as some Indians out west
use. We learned the trick when we were at Star
Ranch. Come on, we’ll soon be with them. It
isn’t very far.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Dave had come down from his high perch in a
hurry, and in a very short time was ready to
leave the spot. Merwell gave a deep sigh, for
he did not relish confronting his former schoolmates.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“It’s tough luck, but I suppose I’ve got to stand
it,” he murmured, as he followed Dave, after
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254'></a>254</span>
the fire had been extinguished. “When a fellow
makes a fool of himself he’s got to take the consequences.”
And this remark was so true that
Dave did not dispute it.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
On they went through the forest and then over
a rocky hill. Three times they came close to falling
into the treacherous holes in which the island
abounded, and the last time poor Merwell got
a fall that almost sprained his ankle.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“We’ll rest a bit and you can bathe the ankle,”
said Dave, kindly, and got some water from a
nearby pool.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I don’t wonder nobody is living on this
island,” grumbled the injured one. “I suppose
the natives around here are too afraid of falling
into some of those holes.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“They are afraid of the caves and also afraid
of volcanoes,” answered Dave. “The mate of
the <em>Golden Eagle</em> told me that. Sometimes the
volcanoes break out here without warning and
cover the rocks with hot ashes.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Is that so? Well, I hope no volcano breaks
out while I am here.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
At last the boys reached a small rise of ground
and at a distance saw the column of smoke, plainly.
Dave put on extra speed and soon saw Phil, Giles
Borden, and several sailors—the survivors from
the ill-fated <em>Emma Brower</em>.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255'></a>255</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Phil!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Dave! At last!” cried the shipowner’s son,
joyfully. “Are you hurt?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Not a bit of it. How are you?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“All right, although I had several tumbles
while hunting for you. You disappeared in the
strangest fashion.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I fell into a cave,—went down with Link
Merwell.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh!” Phil gave a start. “Who is that in
the bushes? Merwell, as sure as I’m alive!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Yes, Phil. And what do you think? I’ve
got part of the jewels—Link had them in his
money-belt.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Good enough! I was so afraid they had been
lost out of that jewel-case. Did you make Merwell
a prisoner?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Well, in a way. He might have run away a
dozen times, but I guess he didn’t want to be alone.
Besides, he has quarreled with Jasniff. I’ll tell
you all about it later,” went on Dave, in a lower
tone.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Merwell had halted and now he came shuffling
into the temporary camp. He nodded sheepishly
to the shipowner’s son and to the sailors.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Got ye, did they?” said one of the tars, with
a sneer.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Yes,” answered the culprit, meekly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256'></a>256</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Humph! You’re a fine Dick to run away and
steal jewels!” muttered the sailor, and turned
his back on the youth.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Where are Roger and Captain Sanders and the
others?” questioned Dave.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Gone after you, and after Jasniff and those
three rascally Englishmen,” answered Phil. “I
said I’d stay here and try that trick with a column
of smoke. I thought you might remember and
look for it.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“It was a good thing to do, Phil,” answered our
hero, “for it brought us straight to this spot.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257'></a>257</span><a name='chXXVII' id='chXXVII'></a>CHAPTER XXVII—BEHIND THE CURTAIN OF VINES</h2>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
An hour went by and during that time Dave
drew Phil to one side and related the particulars
concerning the doings of Merwell and Jasniff, according
to the story told by the former of the two
evil-disposed youths.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I think Link feels pretty sore,” he continued.
“So there won’t be any use in rubbing it in.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“What do you intend to do with him, Dave?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I don’t know yet. We’ll talk it over later on.
The thing to do now is to locate Jasniff and get
the rest of the jewels. Don’t forget that he has
the finest of the diamonds. That is one thing that
made Link sore—Jasniff taking the lion’s share.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Well, that was the way Jasniff always did,
even at school. Now you’ve got back I’m willing
to start the search for him any time you say,” continued
the shipowner’s son.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“We’ll wait a while and see if Roger and Captain
Sanders return,” answered our hero.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
He was glad to rest, and threw himself on a
bed of moss the sailors had collected. Merwell
sat against a tree, tired out, but too much worried
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258'></a>258</span>
to sleep. Evidently he was trying to decide on
what to do next and wondering how he was to get
out of the awful situation in which he found himself.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Presently a shout was heard, and Roger burst
into view, followed an instant later by Billy Dill.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Hello, Dave!” cried the senator’s son. “Got
back, have you?” And then he stared at Merwell.
“Oh, are you here, too?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Yes,” returned the big youth, and that was all
he could say.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Dave, did you get the jewels Merwell had?”
went on Roger.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Yes. But, Roger, how did you know——”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“There is no time to talk it over now, Dave,”
interrupted the senator’s son, quickly. “We have
got to act, and that at once! That is, if you
want to get back the rest of the jewels.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Why, what do you mean?” demanded Dave
and Phil in a breath, and even Merwell was all
attention.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Do you remember those Englishmen, the fellows
who robbed Mr. Borden? Well, we traced
them to their camp, and what do you think? They
met Jasniff in some way, and he is friendly with
them.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Did he tell them about the jewels?” demanded
our hero.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“No, he was cute enough to keep the story of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259'></a>259</span>
the jewels to himself,—that is, we didn’t hear him
tell them anything about the gems. But he said
he wanted to get away from the island as quickly
as possible, and without being seen by any of us,
and he offered the Englishmen a thousand dollars
in diamonds if they’d help him. They agreed to
it, and all hands are waiting for some ship to come
here and take them off.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“The ship I saw last night!” cried Dave, and
told of the light on the ocean.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“It must be that ship!” exclaimed Phil.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“They’ll get away sure, unless you can stop
’em,” put in Merwell, and he seemed to be almost
as interested as anybody. It galled him exceedingly
to think that his companion in crime
might escape.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Roger, how did you learn this?” asked
Dave.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“In a queer kind of a way. Billy Dill got on
the trail of the three Englishmen first and we followed
them to one of the caves. Then one of
the Englishmen went away and after a while he
came back with Jasniff, and all hands went to another
cave, close to the shore. We got into one
part of the cave and overheard what the crowd
said, through a crack in the rocks. We might have
confronted Jasniff and demanded the jewels, but
we saw that the Englishmen were all armed and
they looked to be in an ugly mood, and Captain
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260'></a>260</span>
Sanders wanted no bloodshed if it could be avoided.
So then Billy Dill and I said we would come back
here and get Phil and the sailors.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I should think you’d do your best to capture
Jasniff,” said Merwell.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Do you want him captured?” asked Roger,
sharply.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Why not? He didn’t treat me fairly—and
he planned the robbery in the first place.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Well, if you want him taken you had better
help us,” put in Phil.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Say, Dave, if I help you catch Jasniff and get
the rest of the jewels back, will you—er—will you
let me go?” faltered Link Merwell, anxiously.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I don’t know—I’ll see about it, Link,” answered
Dave, and that was as far as he would
commit himself, for he remembered that this case
was for Mr. Wadsworth and the authorities to
settle.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I’ll help you all I can—just to get square with
Nick!” muttered the big youth. “I’ll show him
that he isn’t the only frog in the puddle.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“The sooner we go the better,” went on the
senator’s son.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I am ready now,” returned Dave. “I’ll not
rest easy until Jasniff is caught and the rest of
those jewels are recovered.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
A few words more were exchanged, and then it
was decided that the whole party should follow
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261'></a>261</span>
Roger and Billy Dill to the spot from whence they
had come.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Borden is very anxious to have the three Englishmen
held,” said the senator’s son.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I suppose he wants to get back his money,”
returned Dave. “I don’t blame him.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
The path was through the forest and then along
a rocky ridge. Here walking was very uncertain,
and Roger warned the others to be careful.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“An’ if ye ain’t careful ye’ll go into a hole to
Kingdom Come!” put in Billy Dill.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
When the ridge was left behind they came to
another patch of timber, and then walked through
a small cave with a large opening at either end.
In the center of this cave was a hole, at the bottom
of which flowed an underground river.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“If ever an island was rightly named, this is the
one,” observed Phil. “It is caves from one end
to the other.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Listen! I thought I heard voices!” exclaimed
Dave, suddenly, and held up his hand for
silence.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
All listened closely and heard a faint murmur,
coming from a distance.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Sounds to me as if it was underground,” whispered
Phil.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Yes, but from what direction?” asked Roger.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I think it comes from over yonder,” answered
Dave. “Let us go there and make sure.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262'></a>262</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
They walked on, soon coming to a spot where
a place between the rocks was covered with a matting
of long vines, much intertwined.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Keep quiet!” suddenly exclaimed our hero.
“I know where they are—behind those vines.
There must be a cave there, and the vines make
a curtain for the entrance.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Who is it?” asked Merwell.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I don’t know yet. Wait, all of you remain
here, behind the rocks, while I investigate.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
As silently as possible, Dave crawled forward,
keeping close to the rocks on one side of the cave’s
entrance. Soon he was up to the curtain of vines,
and cautiously he thrust his hand forward, making
a small opening.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
At first our hero could see little, but as his eyes
became accustomed to the gloom, he made out
two forms lying on couches of vines, smoking.
The forms were those of the two Englishmen,
Pardell and Rumney.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Well, Geswick ought to be coming back,”
Dave heard Rumney say. “He said he wouldn’t
waste any time.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Maybe he had some trouble with that young
fellow,” returned Pardell. “Say, do you know
he’s a queer stick? Where did he get those diamonds
he offered for his passage?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I don’t know, but I rather think he stole
them.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263'></a>263</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Then perhaps he has more of the jewels.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Just what I was thinking—and Geswick
thought the same.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“If he has many of them——” The man
paused suggestively.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“We might relieve him, eh?” returned the
other.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Why not? We cleaned out Borden. Two
jobs of that sort are no worse than one.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
There was a period of silence, and Dave moved
back as quietly as possible to where he had left
his companions.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Rumney and Pardell are there, in a long cave,”
he whispered. “They are waiting for Geswick
and, I think, Jasniff.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“But where are Captain Sanders and Smiley?”
asked the shipowner’s son.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I don’t know. Perhaps they are watching
Jasniff and Geswick—or maybe they have captured
those rascals.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh, let me get at Pardell and Rumney!”
cried Giles Borden. “I’ll teach them to rob me!”
And he started forward, flourishing a heavy stick
he had picked up.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Wait! wait!” returned Dave, and caught him
by the arm. “Don’t go yet. Let us lie low until
Geswick comes, and maybe Jasniff. We may be
able to capture all of them.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Can we handle so many?” asked Roger.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264'></a>264</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I think so. Anyway we can try. Remember,
Captain Sanders and Smiley may be following
Geswick and Jasniff, and if they are, they’ll come
to our aid.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I’ll wait, but it’s a hard thing to do, don’t you
know,” grumbled the Englishman who had been
robbed.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“We had better set a guard, so that we are not
surprised,” advised Phil. “Supposing we scatter
around the rocks and in the vines?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
This was agreed upon, and it was also agreed
that Dave should give a whistle when he wanted
an attack made.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
After this came a long period of waiting. All
remained silent, until, of a sudden, everybody was
startled by a distant cannon shot.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“What in the world can that mean?” cried
Phil, who lay close to our hero.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“It’s a shot from a ship’s cannon, and it came
from the direction of the shore!” returned Dave.
“It may be some sort of a signal.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Do you suppose it’s a summons to Pardell and
Rumney?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“It may be. Wait, I’ll look into the cave again
and see what they are doing.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Losing no time, our hero crawled forward once
more to the position he had before occupied. Then
he pushed the vines aside and looked into the long
cave.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265'></a>265</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
He could not suppress a cry of consternation.
The two Englishmen had vanished!
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“They are gone!” he called to his companions.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Gone!” repeated Phil and Roger.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Don’t tell me that!” fairly shrieked Giles
Borden. “I must catch them and get back my
money!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Where did they go to?” asked Billy Dill, as
he pushed through the curtain of vines.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“They must have left the cave by some other
opening,” answered Dave. “Come on, we’ll soon
find out!” And into the cave he rushed, his chums
and the others in the crowd following.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I see another opening!” cried Merwell, a
minute later. “Look!” And he pointed down a
passageway to the right.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“That’s the way they must have gone!” exclaimed
Giles Borden. “After them, all of you!
If I get back my money, I’ll reward you well!”
And on he sped, with Merwell close at his heels
and the others following.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I don’t know if we are on the right track or
not,” said Dave, to Phil and Roger. “This cave
may have other openings.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Hardly had he spoken when there came a yell
from Giles Borden, followed by a cry from Link
Merwell. Both had fallen into a small hole that
was filled with water. Each was much shaken up,
but unhurt.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266'></a>266</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“It’s a broken neck somebody will get if we are
not careful,” said one of the sailors. “I’d rather
be on the deck of a ship any day than on an island
like this.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Soon they were out in the open once more.
They were on a rise of ground, and not a great distance
away they could see the shore and the rolling
ocean.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“A ship!” cried Roger.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“But not the <em>Golden Eagle</em>!” returned Dave.
“It must be the vessel that was to stop for the
Englishmen.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“It is! It is!” bawled Giles Borden. “And
look, there they are on the shore, ready to embark,
all of them!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Yes, and Jasniff is with them!” added Dave,
Phil, and Roger in a breath.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267'></a>267</span><a name='chXXVIII' id='chXXVIII'></a>CHAPTER XXVIII—IN WHICH THE ENEMY SAILS AWAY</h2>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
It was a startling discovery, and for the moment
Dave and the others did not know what to
do.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Do you see anything of Captain Sanders, or
Smiley?” questioned our hero.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Not a thing,” returned the senator’s son.
“It’s strange, too.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh, cannot we stop them in some manner?”
pleaded Giles Borden.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Come on—we’ll do what we can!” cried
Phil.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“That’s the talk!” put in old Billy Dill. “Oh,
for a gatling gun that we might train on ’em!”
he added.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
All were calculating the distance to the shore.
Between them and the water was a slight hollow,
overgrown with brushwood and vines. How long
would it take to find a path through that hollow?
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“No use in staying here,” was Dave’s comment.
“We’ll get there somehow. But keep out of
sight, if you can. We don’t want them to discover
us until the last minute.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268'></a>268</span>
All moved forward toward the hollow. By
walking well over to the left they managed to
keep a distant row of palms between themselves
and those who were at the water’s edge.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
But progress was slow, as all soon discovered.
The hollow was a treacherous one, full of soft
spots and pitfalls. Less than a hundred feet had
been covered when two of the sailors went down
up to their waists, and a second later Roger followed.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Hold on, Roger! I’ll help you!” cried Dave,
and he and Phil ran to their chum’s assistance.
They did not dare to go near the soft spot and so
all they could do was to throw the senator’s son
a stout vine for use as a rope, and then haul him
out by sheer strength. In the meantime the others
went to the rescue of the two sailors, and they
were hauled out in similar fashion.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“This island certainly is the limit!” gasped
Roger, when he was on firm ground once more.
“I wouldn’t live here if they made me a present
of the whole thing!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“That’s right,” returned Phil. “Because, if
you lived here, you might some day find yourself
buried before your time!” And this quaint
way of expressing it made all of the boys grin in
spite of their excitement.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Beyond the hollow another difficulty confronted
them. Here were some sharp rocks, with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269'></a>269</span>
deep cuts between. They had to climb over the
rocks with extreme care and do not a little jumping,
all of which consumed much valuable
time.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“They’ll be off before we can reach them!”
groaned Dave. “Oh, do hurry, fellows!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I’m coming as fast as I can!” answered Phil.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“So am I,” added Roger.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“You ought to shoot at them, if they won’t
stop,” put in Merwell.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I’ll do what I can,” answered our hero. He
was wondering how far the present situation would
justify the use of firearms.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
At last the rocks were left behind, and the crowd
found themselves in the fringe of palm trees lining
the sandy shore.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Do you see them?” queried Phil, who was
getting winded from his exertions.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“No, I don’t,” returned Dave. He had looked
up and down the sandy strip in vain for a sight of
the Englishmen and Jasniff.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Beyond the beach was the reef with the ever-present
breakers and far beyond this the ship they,
had before sighted. The schooner lay-to with all
sails lowered.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“There they are!” suddenly shouted Billy
Dill. “Too late, boys, too late!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Where? where?” came in a shout from the
lads and from Giles Borden.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270'></a>270</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Look out there, by the reef. Don’t you see
the small boat in the breakers?” went on the old
sailor, pointing with his bronzed hand.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
All gazed in the direction he indicated, and
Dave and Giles Borden could not repress a groan
of dismay. For, riding the swells of the ocean,
could be seen a small boat, manned by two sailors.
In the boat sat four passengers.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“That’s Jasniff, I am sure of it!” cried Phil.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“And those three men are the fellows who
robbed me!” muttered Giles Borden. “Oh, what
luck! Ten minutes too late!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Can’t we follow them in some way?” asked
Roger.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I don’t see how,” answered Dave. “Our rowboat
is on the other side of the island. Besides,
even if we had a boat, I don’t believe we could
catch them before the schooner got underway.
Oh, isn’t it a shame!” And Dave fairly ground
his teeth in helpless dismay.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“If we had a cannon!” murmured old Billy
Dill. “A shot across the bow o’ that craft would
make the cap’n take warnin’, I’m thinkin’!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Do you suppose any other boat is handy?”
asked the Englishman.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“We might look,” returned the senator’s son.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
All were about to run out on the beach when
Dave suddenly called a halt.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Don’t do it,” he said. “If we can’t follow
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271'></a>271</span>
them, it will be best for the present not to show
ourselves.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“How’s that?” demanded Giles Borden.
“It’s a bloody shame to let them go in this fashion.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“If they see us, they’ll know we are after them
and they’ll sail away as fast as possible,” went on
our hero. “If they don’t see us, they may take
their time in getting away, and that will give us
so much better chance to catch them.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Dave is right!” cried the senator’s son. And
the others agreed with him, and all kept concealed
behind the row of palms and the brushwood
and rocks. From that point they watched
the small boat gradually approach the schooner
until it was alongside. Then a rope ladder was
lowered and the passengers mounted to the deck,
after which the rowboat was drawn up on the
davits.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“What ship is that?” asked Phil.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“She is named the <em>Aurora</em>,” answered Giles
Borden.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“The <em>Aurora</em>!” exclaimed Billy Dill. “Do
ye mean the <em>Aurora</em>, Cap’n Jack Hunker?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Yes, that’s the captain’s name.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Why, I know him!” went on the old tar.
“Sailed with him once, in the <em>Peter Cass</em>,—afore
he took command o’ the <em>Aurora</em>. Say, Dave, he
used to be a putty good man. I can’t see how he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272'></a>272</span>
would stand in with sech fellers as Jasniff an’ them
thievin’ Britishers.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Perhaps he doesn’t know what scoundrels they
are,” returned our hero.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh, they haven’t told him the truth, depend
upon that,” said Giles Borden. “They have fixed
up some story to pull the wool over his eyes.
Most likely they’ll tell him that I am the rascal
of the party and that is why I am to be left behind.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“If the captain of the <em>Aurora</em> is all right, it
may pay to signal to him,” mused Dave. “I
wish I had known of this before.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“See! see! they are hoisting the sails!” cried
Phil.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“If you are going to signal to the schooner,
you had better do it pretty quick,” advised
Roger.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I think I will. It can’t hurt much—they
are going to sail away, anyhow. Come on.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
All ran out on the sandy beach, and Dave discharged
his shotgun twice as a signal. The others
waved tree-branches and brushwood, and Phil even
lit some of the latter, to make a smudge.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
But if the signals were seen, no attention was
paid to them. Those on the schooner continued
to hoist the sails, and presently the <em>Aurora</em> turned
away, leaving Cave Island behind.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
As the schooner moved off Dave’s heart sank
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273'></a>273</span>
within him. On board of the craft was Jasniff,
and the rascal had the larger portion of the Carwith
jewels in his possession.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“It’s a shame!” burst out Phil. “Oh, why
didn’t we get hold of Jasniff when you collared
Link!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Where is your own ship?” asked Merwell.
“Why don’t you find her and follow that crowd?”
He felt as sour as ever over the thought that he
had been captured while his companion in crime
had escaped.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I wish the <em>Golden Eagle</em> would come in,”
answered Dave. “I can’t understand what is
keeping her, unless she suffered from that storm
and had to lay to for repairs.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“And where do you suppose Captain Sanders
and Smiley are?” put in Roger.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I don’t know. They may have fallen into
one of the caves, or they may have been made
prisoners by those who have sailed away.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Prisoners? I never thought of that!” exclaimed
Giles Borden. “Yes, it would be just
like Geswick and those other scoundrels to treat
them in that fashion.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Well, it won’t do us any good to remain
here,” went on our hero. “We may as well scatter
and see if we can’t locate the captain and the
others.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
This was considered good advice and tired
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274'></a>274</span>
as the crowd was, all went on the hunt, some
up the shore and some down, and the others
inland.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Dave and Roger walked down the shore, why
neither could exactly tell. They passed the palms
and brushwood, and leaving the sand, commenced
to climb over some rocks. Then Dave began to
shout.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
At first no reply came to his calls, but presently
he heard a groan, coming from behind the rocks.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Let us see what it means!” he exclaimed to
the senator’s son, and they hurried in the direction
of the sound with all speed.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Back of the rocks was a grove of plantains,
and in the center was the remains of a thatched
hut, evidently built by natives years before. On
the ground in front of this hut lay Captain Sanders
and the sailor, Smiley. Each had his head
bound up and each was nursing a bruised ankle.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Captain Sanders!” cried Dave, in astonishment.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Dave Porter!” returned the commander of
the <em>Golden Eagle</em>, joyfully. “My, but I am glad
you have come!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“You are hurt?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Yes. Those scoundrels attacked us from behind
and knocked us senseless.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“You mean those three Englishmen?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275'></a>275</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Yes, and that fellow Jasniff was with
them.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“But your ankles are hurt, too?” went on
Dave.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“We hurt them when we fell into one of the
beastly caves, or holes. We were following Jasniff
and the Englishmen, and also looking for
you and the others. Then those rascals got behind
us in some way, and the first thing I knew
I got a whack behind the ear that knocked me unconscious.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“And I got the same,” said Smiley. “Oh, I
wish I had my hands on those villains!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“They have sailed away,” said Roger.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Away!” cried the captain. “How?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
In a few brief words our hero and his chum
told of the advance to the beach and of what they
and the others had witnessed. Captain Sanders
shook his head, soberly.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“That’s too bad,” he said. “They’ve got a
good start and it will be hard to follow them.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“How can we follow them, when the <em>Golden
Eagle</em> isn’t here?” said Dave.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“But she is here—on the other side of the
island.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh, are you sure?” cried our hero.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Yes. I saw her coming in,—when we were on
one of the hills. She was minus her foretopmast,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276'></a>276</span>
which shows she must have suffered some in that
hurricane.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“If that’s the case, let us get to her with all
possible speed, go aboard, and follow the <em>Aurora</em>,”
returned Dave.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277'></a>277</span><a name='chXXIX' id='chXXIX'></a>CHAPTER XXIX—A CHASE ON THE OCEAN</h2>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
It took the best part of the afternoon and
evening to get the whole party together again,
and send word to the mate of the <em>Golden Eagle</em>
to bring the vessel around to that side of Cave
Island. And while this was being done the hurts
Captain Sanders and Smiley had received were
cared for as well as the means at hand permitted.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
The captain and the wounded sailor had a
long story to tell, of how they had followed the
three rascally Englishmen and Nick Jasniff, and
how the latter had made a compact with the others,
so that they would take him with them when they
left the island.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“The Englishmen were a bit afraid of the
captain of the <em>Aurora</em>,” said Captain Sanders,
“and we overheard them discuss the situation.
They knew the captain would want to know what
had become of the fourth man he had left here.
At last they resolved to try a trick, but they weren’t
sure it would work. But evidently it did, for the
schooner has sailed.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“What was that trick?” asked Dave.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278'></a>278</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“It seems that when Mr. Borden was on the
<em>Aurora</em> he had a headache from the sun and wore
smoked glasses. Is that right, sir?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“It is,” answered Giles Borden. “The glare
on the waves was beastly, and I wore the smoked
glasses all day long.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Well, the rascals planned to have Jasniff impersonate
Mr. Borden. One of them, Geswick,
exchanged coats and caps with him, and lent him
a pair of smoked glasses, and he was to tie up
his cheeks and pretend to be suffering from toothache,
and keep to his stateroom as much as possible
during the trip.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh, what a thing to do—impersonate me!”
roared Giles Borden, in a rage. “Just wait till
I confront him!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Yes, you’ll have to wait,” put in Phil, dryly.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Did you find out where they were going to
sail to?” asked Dave, eagerly.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“To San Juan, on the island of Porto Rico.
But they may make some stops on the way.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“San Juan,” mused Roger. “That’s a good
many miles from here. Perhaps the <em>Golden
Eagle</em> can catch the <em>Aurora</em> before she gets there.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“If they went to San Juan direct I’d advise
waiting till they got in that harbor before I’d do
anything,” said Captain Sanders.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Why?” asked the boys.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Because it is one thing to stop them on the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279'></a>279</span>
high seas and another to stop them in United
States waters. Remember, Porto Rico is now a
part of Uncle Sam’s domain.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Yes, I’d rather go at them there than on the
high seas,” answered Dave. “But they mustn’t
get away again, no matter where we have to tackle
them,” he added, determinedly.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
It was impossible to transfer those ashore to the
<em>Golden Eagle</em> during the darkness, because of the
danger in the breakers, so they had to wait until
daylight before departing.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Among those to go were, of course, the sailors
who had come ashore from the wreck of the
<em>Emma Brower</em>. Captain Sanders told them they
could remain on the island if they wished, but they
set up an immediate protest.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“It’s not a fit place for any man,” said one
of the tars. “There is very little game and not
much fruit, and one is continually in danger of
falling into a hole or a cave. I’ll go to Porto
Rico gladly, and so will my mates, and we’ll work
our passage, if you’re willing.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“All right,” said Captain Sanders. “But you’ll
not have much to do, as we have about all the
hands we need.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
When aboard the ship, the captain and the
boys listened to the story the mate had to tell.
Then they learned that the storm had blown the
<em>Golden Eagle</em> many miles from Cave Island, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280'></a>280</span>
in trying to avoid some of the keys of another
island, the vessel had lost the top of one of the
masts and the rudder had been damaged. This
had necessitated much delay, which accounted for
the non-appearance of the vessel when expected.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
While making repairs, the vessel had been
passed by a tramp steamer bound for Trinidad.
The captain of the steamer had asked if he could
be of assistance, and after being told no, had given
the information that he had picked up three rowboat
loads of passengers and crew from the ill-fated
<em>Emma Brower</em>. It may be mentioned here
that another boat load from the same vessel managed
to reach another island in that vicinity, and
in the end it was learned that the going down of
the bark was unattended with the loss of a single
life.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
With so many on board, the accommodations on
the <em>Golden Eagle</em> were somewhat crowded. The
sailors went with Billy Dill into the forecastle,
while Giles Borden was asked to share Captain
Sanders’ stateroom. What to do with Link Merwell
became a question. In one sense he was a
prisoner, yet Dave hated to treat him as such.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“There is the extra pantry,” said Captain Sanders.
“We can clean that out and put in a cot,
and he can use that,” and so it was arranged,
much to the relief of all of the boys. The pantry
had a grating, opening on the main passageway, so it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281'></a>281</span>
made a fairly comfortable stateroom,
although rather hot.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Well, I suppose I’ve got to take my medicine,
when we get back,” grumbled Link Merwell, when
given his quarters.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“What else could you expect?” returned Dave.
“If this was my affair alone, Link, I might let
you go, now you have given up the jewels. But
what is to be done is for Mr. Wadsworth and the
authorities to say.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Merwell had confessed that he and Jasniff had
taken the skates and other things at Squirrel Island,
and told where they had been left, in a barn along
the river, and how they might be recovered. He
had also admitted impersonating Dave on several
occasions and ordering goods in our hero’s name,
and doing other mean things of which he had
been suspected, and said he was heartily sorry for
his actions.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Soon the <em>Golden Eagle</em> was ready for the departure
from Cave Island. As the sails were
hoisted the boys gathered on deck to take a last
look at the remarkable spot.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“It is really and truly Cave Island,” declared
Dave. “I don’t believe any other place in the
world is so full of caves and holes!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I am glad the volcanoes didn’t get busy while
we were there,” remarked the shipowner’s son.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“So am I,” added Roger. “The caves and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282'></a>282</span>
holes were bad enough, without adding other
perils.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Dave, do you think we’ll catch that
schooner?” went on Phil, after a pause, during
which the boys watched the ship drawing away
from the island.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I sincerely hope so,” was the serious reply.
“If we don’t, and Jasniff gets away, this mission
down here will have proved almost a failure.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Then you think Jasniff has the most of the
jewels?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Yes. If you’ll remember, the jewels that were
taken were valued at about seventy-five thousand
dollars. Well, I have looked at the jewels I got
from Link, and so has Mr. Borden, who knows
something about gems, and we have come to the
conclusion that those Link turned over to me are
not worth over fifteen thousand dollars. That
means that Jasniff has about sixty thousand
dollars’ worth.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Isn’t that like Jasniff!” cried the senator’s
son. “Always wanted the big end of everything!
It’s a wonder he and Link didn’t quarrel before.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“They did quarrel, and Link wanted to leave
him several times, but didn’t dare, for Jasniff
threatened to expose him. In one way, I am
sorry for Link,—but, of course, he had no right to
commit such a deed.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
After Cave Island was left in the distance, Captain
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283'></a>283</span>
Sanders had a long conference with Giles Borden
concerning the Englishmen who had robbed
him. Later a general talk took place between the
pair and the boys.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I am afraid we’ll have to trust to luck to catch
the <em>Aurora</em> or locate her,” said the captain, finally.
“She may go to San Juan and she may go elsewhere.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“If we pass any other vessels, can’t we ask if
they saw the schooner?” ventured Dave.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Certainly.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
The day went by and also the next. Link
Merwell kept to himself, only speaking when addressed.
He felt his position keenly, and would
no doubt have given a great deal if he could have
cleared himself. He was learning that the way
of the transgressor is hard.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
On the third day, early in the morning, they
passed a big barkentine bound for South American
ports. Greetings were exchanged, and Captain
Sanders asked concerning the <em>Aurora</em>.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Yes, we met her,” was the reply. “Yesterday,
about two bells in the afternoon watch.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Did she say where she was bound?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Bound for San Juan, Porto Rico.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Direct?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Yes. She was going to stop elsewhere, but
the captain allowed he’d make straight for San
Juan,” added the captain of the barkentine,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284'></a>284</span>
through the megaphone he was using. Then, after
a few words more, the two vessels separated.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“It’s San Juan sure!” cried Dave. “From
what Mr. Borden and Billy Dill say of Captain
Hunker he would not tell a falsehood. I guess
the best thing we can do is to sail for that
port.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I think so myself,” returned Captain Sanders.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
The chase was now a definite one, and Dave
felt much relieved. He wondered if they would be
able to overtake the <em>Aurora</em> before Porto Rico
was reached.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“We can do that with ease,” answered Captain
Sanders when questioned. “But even so, she may
not stick to just the course we take, and we may
pass her in the night. So don’t worry if we don’t
see or hear anything before San Juan is reached.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I’ll try not to worry,” answered our hero.
Yet he could not help it, for so much depended on
the successful outcome of his mission. He knew
that those at home must be in deep distress, and
he could picture the anxiety of Mr. Wadsworth
and his wife and Jessie, and also the anxiety of
his own folks.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh, we’ve got to catch Jasniff and get back
those jewels!” he told himself. “We’ve simply
got to do it! I won’t give up, if I have to follow
him around the world!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
It had been warm, but now the weather changed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285'></a>285</span>
and a strong breeze made living far more comfortable.
The breeze was favorable to sailing, and
the <em>Golden Eagle</em> plowed the deep at a good rate
of speed. Many of the islands of the Lesser Antilles
were passed, and some truly dangerous reefs,
and then the course was straight for the harbor of
San Juan, on the northeastern coast of Porto
Rico.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
They had seen nothing so far of the <em>Aurora</em>,
but on the afternoon of the last day out they were
passed by a freight steamer from the south and
received word that the schooner was not far away
and making for San Juan.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I guess we had better go right in and get the
authorities to take hold,” said Captain Sanders.
“This is no matter for us to handle, now we are
in United States waters once more.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Dave agreed; and as soon as possible they entered
the harbor and went ashore. It was an easy
matter to notify the harbor police, and inside of
two hours half a dozen officers of the law were
detailed to make the necessary arrests. Dave and
Giles Borden and Captain Sanders went with
them, leaving Phil, Roger, and the others aboard
the <em>Golden Eagle</em>.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
The patrol boat of the harbor police had to
remain on the watch all night and half the next
morning before the <em>Aurora</em> was sighted.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“There she is!” cried Dave, at last, and Giles
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286'></a>286</span>
Borden echoed the words. Then the patrol boat
lost no time in steaming alongside of the schooner.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Hello, what’s wanted?” demanded Captain
Hunker, as he saw the officers of the law.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“We’ll come aboard, captain,” said the officer
in charge.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“What’s the matter?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“We are after four of your passengers.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
At that moment somebody appeared near the
rail, to learn what the shouting meant. It was
Nick Jasniff. He gazed at the officers of the law
and then at Dave. As he recognized our hero his
face fell and he looked totally dumfounded.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287'></a>287</span><a name='chXXX' id='chXXX'></a>CHAPTER XXX—HOMEWARD BOUND—CONCLUSION</h2>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Jasniff, I want to see you!” shouted Dave.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“What do you want of me, Dave Porter?”
returned the big youth, as boldly as he could.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“You know well enough.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Humph! You think you’ve got me, don’t
you?” sneered Nick Jasniff, and then he left the
rail of the vessel and disappeared down a companionway.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
By this time the officers of the law were boarding
the <em>Aurora</em>, accompanied by Giles Borden and
Captain Sanders.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Where are those bloody rascals who robbed
me?” exclaimed the Englishman, excitedly.
“Just let me get my hands on them!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I don’t understand this!” returned the captain
of the schooner, in surprise. “You’ll have to
explain.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“You have three Englishmen aboard here—fellows
you took to Cave Island when I was with
them.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Say, you’re that fourth man!” gasped Captain
Hunker. “But that other chap,—the fellow with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288'></a>288</span>
smoked glasses, who had his face tied up——”
He did not know how to go on.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“He impersonated me, the villain! But I am
after the others, for they robbed me of over a
thousand pounds, don’t you know!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Where are your passengers?” demanded the
officer in charge of those from the patrol boat,
sternly.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“If they are not on deck they must be below,—they
had no chance to leave the ship,” answered
Captain Hunker. “This gets me!” he went on,
weakly. “I thought they acted rather strange,
but I supposed they were nothing but a crowd of
weak-minded critters hunting for pirates’ gold.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
At that moment Geswick, Pardell, and Rumney
came on deck, having heard the tramping of feet
overhead and wondering what it meant. Almost
before he could speak, Giles Borden had Geswick
by the throat and was shaking him violently.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Will rob me, and leave me a prisoner in that
cave!” he roared. “I’ll teach you a lesson! Give
me my money, you bloody scoundrel!” And then
he banged Andrew Geswick’s head against a
mast.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Ho, let up!” yelled the criminal. “Let up,
I say!” And he tried to squirm away. But it
was useless, and in a minute more one of the officers
of the law handcuffed him, and Pardell and
Rumney were also secured.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289'></a>289</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Now I want my money!” stormed Giles Borden.
“Every shilling of it!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I haven’t any of it,” replied Rumney. “Geswick
and Pardell have it all.” Rumney had had a
quarrel with his fellows, just as Merwell had quarreled
with Jasniff.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Just you wait, Rumney; we’ll fix you for going
back on us,” growled Andrew Geswick. But this
threat did him little good. In the end he and
Pardell had to hand over every penny taken from
Giles Borden, and then they were marched off to
jail, to await a hearing before the authorities.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
In the meantime Dave had run across the deck
and followed Jasniff down the companionway.
He was afraid that the evil-minded youth might
hide the stolen jewels or throw them overboard.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
When he got below he looked around, but could
see nothing of the other boy. He ran along a
passageway, peering into one stateroom after another,
and also into the cabin and the pantry.
Then he heard something like a cover drop near
by and hurried in that direction.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Jasniff was in a corner stateroom on his hands
and knees. Beside him was a flat steamer trunk,
which was closed. It was the lid of this trunk
that Dave had heard drop.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Jasniff, come out of that!” ordered Dave,
sternly. “Come right out and hand over those
jewels.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290'></a>290</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Say, Dave Porter, you think you are smart,
don’t you?” sneered the big youth, as he got up
on his feet.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Never mind what I think. I want those
jewels, every one of them, and I am going to
have them.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I haven’t any jewels.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I know better.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“All right then, you can search me if you want
to—and search my baggage, too,” went on Jasniff,
and held out his arms as if willing to have the investigation
begin on the spot.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“If you haven’t the jewels on your person, you
have hidden them,” went on Dave. “Bring them
out, right away.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Not much, Porter, I am not that kind of a
fool.” Jasniff lowered his voice to a whisper.
“To outsiders I won’t acknowledge I have the
jewels, but if you’ll fix it so I go clear, I’ll see to it
that old Wadsworth gets the gems back.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I’ll fix nothing, Jasniff, and you’ll hand over
every jewel, and do it right now!” cried Dave, and
now he was so angry that he leaped on the criminal
and threw him backward over the trunk.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
But if Dave was strong, so was Jasniff, and, as
of old, the rascal thought nothing of playing a
foul trick. Around and around the stateroom
went both boys, with first Dave on top and then
his opponent. Then suddenly Jasniff pulled himself
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291'></a>291</span>
away and caught up a water pitcher that was
on a stand.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I’ll fix you!” he roared, in the same tone of
voice he had employed when he had once attacked
Dave in the Oak Hall gymnasium, and he brought
the heavy pitcher down straight for Dave’s head.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Had the blow landed as intended, our hero
would have been knocked senseless and perhaps
seriously hurt. But quick as the bully was, Dave
was quicker, and leaped to one side. Then he
let out with his fist, landing on Jasniff’s jaw,—a
blow that sent the fellow crashing over into a
corner. As Jasniff came up, Dave hit him again,
and this time he went down all but knocked out.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Dave!” called a voice from the doorway at
that moment, and Captain Sanders appeared.
“Having a tussle, eh? Want any help?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“May be,” panted our hero. “He attacked
me with the water-pitcher!” And he pointed to
the fragments of chinaware that lay on the floor.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Do-don’t h-hit me again!” spluttered Nick
Jasniff.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Will you hand over the jewels and behave
yourself?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I—I haven’t got the jewels,” and now Jasniff
arose unsteadily to his feet.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Perhaps he’s hidden them,” suggested the
captain of the <em>Golden Eagle</em>. “It would be like
him to do it.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292'></a>292</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I’ll search him first and then look around the
room. Where are those officers?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“They have their hands full just now with
those Englishmen. But I’ll call them if you wish
it.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“No, just see that he doesn’t get away,” answered
Dave.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
A rapid search of Jasniff’s clothing told our
hero that the rascal did not have the gems on his
person. Then Dave looked into the steamer
trunk.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Are they there?” inquired Captain Sanders.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“No.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“You’ll never get them from me,” growled
Jasniff, and gave Dave a look that was full of the
keenest hatred. “I’ll go to prison for life before
I’ll give them up, now!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Watch him carefully,” said Dave to the captain,
and got down on his hands and knees in
front of the berth in the room.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Nothing under there!” cried Jasniff, but his
voice had a trace of anxiety in it.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Dave felt around, but found nothing unusual.
Then he lit a match and continued his search.
Soon he saw where a board of the side wall had
been pried loose and then shoved back into place.
He pulled on the board and it came out, revealing
a small compartment between two upright posts.
In the compartment was something wrapped in a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293'></a>293</span>
bandanna handkerchief. He pulled it out and
crawled from under the berth.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I think I’ve found it,” he said, in a voice he
tried in vain to steady. Then he untied the handkerchief
and brought to light a money belt, exactly
like that taken from Link Merwell. He
placed it on the steamer trunk and opened it with
care. The sight that met his gaze was a dazzling
one. The money-belt contained all that Jasniff
had carried of the Carwith jewels.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“My, but that’s a sight!” murmured Captain
Sanders.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Going to return them, I suppose,” sneered
Nick Jasniff. “You’re a big fool to do it! I’d
keep them, and have a good time on the proceeds.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I am not built that way,” answered Dave,
shortly. “I’ll put this around my waist, with the
other,” he added, and lost no time in adjusting
the second money-belt. It wasn’t particularly comfortable
to wear those two belts, yet Dave felt
a tremendous satisfaction in so doing.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Jasniff was made to march on deck, and there
he was handcuffed like the other prisoners. He
no longer pretended to have a toothache, but he
did have a jaw-ache, from Dave’s blow.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
The most surprised man was Captain Hunker,
and he readily told his story of how the Englishmen
had hired him to take them to Cave Island
and then call for them later. When Jasniff had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294'></a>294</span>
appeared, with the smoked glasses and the bandage
on his face, he had pitied the fellow but had
not paid much attention to him. When Dave had
fired his gun from the shore, Geswick had explained
that other fortune hunters were on the
island but that they wanted nothing to do with the
crowd, so the master of the <em>Aurora</em> had gone off
without investigating.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Inside of an hour all of the interested parties
had gone ashore, and the three rascally Englishmen
and Nick Jasniff were marched off by the
officers of the law. Roger and Phil appeared and
wanted to know the particulars of the capture.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“And what are you going to do next, Dave?”
asked the senator’s son.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Get back to Crumville with the jewels, just
as soon as I can get away. But I’ve got to arrange
it with the police first.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Aren’t you going to send word ahead?” asked
Phil.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Of course. I’ll send a cablegram to-day.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Won’t they be surprised and glad to get it!”
murmured Roger.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“And maybe I’m not glad to be able to take
the jewels back with me!” answered Dave, his
eyes glistening.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
An officer had been sent to take charge of Link
Merwell, who had been left on board the <em>Golden
Eagle</em>. An hour later came word that Merwell
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295'></a>295</span>
could not be found. He had left the vessel in
some mysterious manner, dressing himself in one
of Dave’s best suits before going. A little later
Dave learned that Merwell had left San Juan for
the interior of Porto Rico. The officers of the
law said they would look for him.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
The cablegram to Mr. Wadsworth was sent, and
soon a reply came back. Then came nearly a week
of waiting for a steamer that would take the boys
to New York. In the meantime matters were arranged
with the authorities so that they could get
away, and take the jewels with them. A detective
accompanied them, to make certain that the
jewels would be properly delivered, for the whole
case was now in the hands of the law. Giles Borden
remained in San Juan, to press his charge
against his fellow countrymen. Captain Sanders
remained in the harbor, to await orders from Phil’s
father.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Sorry to part with you boys,” said the captain,
as he shook hands. “Hope you’ll sail with
me again some day.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“An’ sail with me, too,” put in old Billy Dill,
who was present, and as much interested as anybody.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“But not on such a mission as this has been,”
returned Dave.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Nor to such a place as Cave Island,” added
Roger.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296'></a>296</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“For caves and pitfalls that island certainly
was the limit,” was Phil’s comment.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
The voyage to New York proved to be uneventful,
and all of the lads were glad when it was
over. Arriving in the metropolis, they lost no
time in getting a train for Crumville, the detective
going with them, and Dave carrying the precious
jewels.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
And then what a home-coming followed! All
the Wadsworths and the Porters were at the depot
to meet them, and everybody was brimming over
with good feeling. Mrs. Wadsworth fairly
hugged Dave, and Laura kissed him over and
over again, and even Jessie could not resist the
temptation to rush into his arms.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh, Dave, to think you really got the jewels!”
said Jessie. “Oh, I’m so glad! What a hero
you are!” And she gave him a look that touched
him to the bottom of the heart.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
And then came Mr. Wadsworth, his voice shaking
with emotion, and then Dave’s father, and
Uncle Dunston.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“One lad out of a million!” murmured the
manufacturer. “Mr. Porter, you can well be
proud of Dave!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“And I am proud of him,” replied the parent,
heartily.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“We are all proud,” added Dunston Porter.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
In the excitement it must not be supposed that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297'></a>297</span>
Phil and Roger were forgotten. While Dave related
his story to the men, and delivered the jewels
to Mr. Wadsworth, his chums had to tell about all
that had occurred, to Mrs. Wadsworth and the
girls. And the questions that were asked and answered
would fill a chapter and more.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“And what will they do to Jasniff?” asked
Laura.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Undoubtedly put him in prison for a number
of years,” answered the senator’s son. “And he
deserves it.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“What a misspent life!” sighed Mrs. Wadsworth.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“And what about Link Merwell?” asked
Jessie.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“I don’t know what they’ll do to him. Perhaps
they won’t catch him,” said Phil.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“If they don’t, I hope he turns over a new leaf
and makes a real man of himself,” said Laura.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
Dave had gone to the jewelry works with the
men, and soon Phil and Roger followed. Here
the jewels were examined with care, being checked
off on a list,—the duplicate of a receipt Oliver
Wadsworth had given to the owner of the
gems.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Four stones are missing,” announced the manufacturer.
“And they are worth less than a thousand
dollars. Dave, you certainly did well.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“We can get back at least two of those stones,”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298'></a>298</span>
answered Dave. “The pawnbrokers will have to
give them up.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Then the loss will be less than five hundred
dollars—a mere trifle alongside of what it might
have been. Dave, I’ll not offer you a reward, for
I know you won’t take it. But I thank you, my
boy, I thank you most heartily!” And Mr. Wadsworth
caught Dave by both hands, while tears of
emotion stood in his eyes.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“It saved us all from a tight place, if not ruin,”
added Dunston Porter.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“How is that old watchman?” asked our hero,
to change the subject.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“You mean the man who was hurt?” asked his
father. “He is about as well as ever.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“And have you heard from Hooker Montgomery?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Not a word, and we sha’n’t need to, now.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Any word from Oak Hall?” asked Roger.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Yes, the place opened again last week.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Then I suppose we’ll have to get back once
more,” said Phil. “Well, we’ve had a long enough
vacation,—if you can call it such,” he added, with
a grin.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“And such adventures!” murmured Roger.
“We’ll never see such strenuous times again, eh,
Dave?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“There is no telling, we may,” answered Dave.
There were still many adventures ahead, and what
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299'></a>299</span>
they were will be related in the next volume of
this series, to be entitled, “Dave Porter and the
Runaways; or, Last Days at Oak Hall,” in which
we shall meet our hero and his chums and enemies
once more.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“If we are to go back to Oak Hall so soon, let
us have all the fun we can,” said Dave, after the
matter of the jewels had been settled; and the next
day he and his chums and the girls went out for
a grand sleighride, for it was still winter at home,
even though it had been like summer on Cave
Island.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Dave, are you glad to be back?” asked Jessie,
while they were gliding over the snow.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Yes, I am,” he answered. “And doubly glad
to be here, at your side,” he added, in a lower
voice.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh, Dave, I was so afraid while you were
away!”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Of what?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“That those bad boys would harm you! Oh,
please be careful in the future, for my sake.”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“All right, Jessie, I’ll be careful,” he answered,
and then, under the big robe, he gave her little
hand a tight squeeze, and I don’t know but that
Jessie gave him a squeeze in return. To her Dave
was the finest boy in all the world.
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Let’s have a song!” cried out Phil, from the
seat in front.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300'></a>300</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Right you are!” returned Dave. “What
shall it be?”
</p>
<p style='margin-right: 2em;'>
“Oh, anything!” came from the girls in concert;
and then they started to sing one familiar
song after another; and while they are singing let
us say good-by and take our leave.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
